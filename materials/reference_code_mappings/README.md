# reference_code_mappings

This folder contains a csv file which contains the mapping between the reference codes used by Goldberg et al. in their reviews (the series starts here: https://doi.org/10.1063/1.555939), and the corresponding PMIDs (PubMed IDs, https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) and DOIs.

For example, "49MEY/GRE" can be looked up in the bibliography of the reviews for their meaning (it's shorthand code for "publication from 1949, first author's family name starts with "mey", second author's family name starts with "gre""). "49MEY/GRE" is a paper by Meyerhof and Green: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18116987/
