TI  - Ether Hydrolysis, Ether Thiolysis, and the Catalytic Power of Etherases in the 
      Disassembly of Lignin.

AB  - The recycling of much of the carbon in Nature depends on the breakdown of polymers 
      in woody matter, notably cellulose (a polyacetal) and lignin (a polyether). Here, we 
      show that equilibrium favors ether hydrolysis in water, although the rates of 
      spontaneous hydrolysis of ethers are too slow to measure in neutral solution except 
      at temperatures approaching the critical point of water. Circumventing that kinetic 
      obstacle, glutathione-dependent etherases from white-rot fungi are known to employ 
      the thiolate group of glutathione to attack guaiacyl ethers. Experiments at elevated 
      temperatures indicate that thioglycolate attacks diethyl ether in water, in the 
      absence of enzymes, with a rate constant of 6 × 10(-11) M(-1) s(-1) at 25 °C and 
      that ether thiolysis is strongly favored thermodynamically, with a K(eq) value of 
      2.5 × 10(6) (ΔG = -8.7 kcal/mol). Compared with the rate of non-enzymatic thiolysis, 
      the lignin-degrading etherases LigE and LigF produce 10(15)-fold rate enhancements, 
      among the largest that have been observed for an enzyme acting on two substrates.

AB  - The kinetics and mechanism(s) of the reactions of [K(Krypt)][LCuO(2)] (Krypt = 
      4,7,13,16,21,24-hexaoxa-1,10-diazabicyclo[8.8.8]hexacosane, L = a 
      bis(arylcarboxamido)pyridine ligand) with 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperdine- N-hydroxide 
      (TEMPOH) and the para-substituted phenols (X)ArOH (X = para substituent NO(2), 
      CF(3), Cl, H, Me, (t)Bu, OMe, or NMe(2)) at low temperatures were studied. The 
      reaction with TEMPOH occurs rapidly ( k = 35.4 ± 0.3 M(-1) s(-1)) by second-order 
      kinetics to yield TEMPO(•) and [LCuOOH](-) on the basis of electron paramagnetic 
      resonance spectroscopy, the production of H(2)O(2) upon treatment with protic acid, 
      and independent preparation from reaction of [NBu(4)][LCuOH] with H(2)O(2) ( K(eq) = 
      0.022 ± 0.007 for the reverse reaction). The reactions with (X)ArOH also follow 
      second-order kinetics, and analysis of the variation of the k values as a function 
      of phenol properties (Hammett σ parameter, O-H bond dissociation free energy, p 
      K(a), E(1/2)) revealed a change in mechanism across the series, from proton 
      transfer/electron transfer for X = NO(2), CF(3), Cl to concerted-proton/electron 
      transfer (or hydrogen-atom transfer) for X = OMe, NMe(2) (data for X = H, Me, (t)Bu 
      are intermediate between the extremes). Thermodynamic analysis and comparisons to 
      previous results for LCuOH, a different copper-oxygen intermediate with the same 
      supporting ligand, and literature for other [CuO(2)](+) complexes reveal significant 
      differences in proton-coupled electron-transfer mechanisms that have implications 
      for understanding oxidation catalysis by copper-containing enzymes and abiological 
      catalysts.

AB  - Cells evolved robust homeostatic mechanisms to protect against oxidation or 
      alkylation by electrophilic species. Glutathione (GSH) is the most abundant 
      intracellular thiol, protects cellular components from oxidation and is maintained 
      in a reduced state by glutathione reductase (GR). Nitro oleic acid (NO(2)-OA) is an 
      electrophilic fatty acid formed under digestive and inflammatory conditions that 
      both reacts with GSH and induces its synthesis upon activation of Nrf2 signaling. 
      The effects of NO(2)-OA on intracellular GSH homeostasis were evaluated. In addition 
      to upregulation of GSH biosynthesis, we observed that NO(2)-OA increased 
      intracellular GSSG in an oxidative stress-independent manner. NO(2)-OA directly 
      inhibited GR in vitro by covalent modification of the catalytic Cys61, with k(on) of 
      (3.45 ± 0.04) × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), k(off) of (4.4 ± 0.4) × 10(-4) s(-1), and K(eq) 
      of (1.3 ± 0.1) × 10(-7) M. Akin to NO(2)-OA, the electrophilic Nrf2 activators 
      bardoxolone-imidazole (CDDO-Im), bardoxolone-methyl (CDDO-Me) and dimethyl fumarate 
      (DMF) also upregulated GSH biosynthesis while promoting GSSG accumulation, but 
      without directly inhibiting GR activity. In vitro assays in which GR was treated 
      with increasing GSH concentrations and GSH depletion experiments in cells revealed 
      that GR activity is finely regulated via product inhibition, an observation further 
      supported by theoretical (kinetic modeling of cellular GSSG:GSH levels) approaches. 
      Together, these results describe two independent mechanisms by which electrophiles 
      modulate the GSH/GSSG couple, and provide a novel conceptual framework to interpret 
      experimentally determined values of GSH and GSSG.

TI  - cAMP and Vfr Control Exolysin Expression and Cytotoxicity of Pseudomonas aeruginosa 
      Taxonomic Outliers.
LID - 10.1128/JB.00135-18 [doi]
LID - e00135-18
AB  - The two-partner secretion system ExlBA, expressed by strains of Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa belonging to the PA7 group, induces hemorrhage in lungs due to disruption 
      of host cellular membranes. Here we demonstrate that the exlBA genes are controlled 
      by a pathway consisting of cAMP and the virulence factor regulator (Vfr). Upon 
      interaction with cAMP, Vfr binds directly to the exlBA promoter with high affinity 
      (equilibrium binding constant [K(eq)] of ≈2.5 nM). The exlB and exlA expression was 
      diminished in the Vfr-negative mutant and upregulated with increased intracellular 
      cAMP levels. The Vfr binding sequence in the exlBA promoter was mutated in situ, 
      resulting in reduced cytotoxicity of the mutant, showing that Vfr is required for 
      the exlBA expression during intoxication of epithelial cells. Vfr also regulates 
      function of type 4 pili previously shown to facilitate ExlA activity on epithelial 
      cells, which indicates that the cAMP/Vfr pathway coordinates these two factors 
      needed for full cytotoxicity. As in most P. aeruginosa strains, the adenylate 
      cyclase CyaB is the main provider of cAMP for Vfr regulation during both in vitro 
      growth and eukaryotic cell infection. We discovered that the absence of functional 
      Vfr in the reference strain PA7 is caused by a frameshift in the gene and accounts 
      for its reduced cytotoxicity, revealing the conservation of ExlBA control by the 
      CyaB-cAMP/Vfr pathway in P. aeruginosa taxonomic outliers.IMPORTANCE The human 
      opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa provokes severe acute and chronic 
      human infections associated with defined sets of virulence factors. The main 
      virulence determinant of P. aeruginosa taxonomic outliers is exolysin, a 
      membrane-disrupting pore-forming toxin belonging to the two-partner secretion system 
      ExlBA. In this work, we demonstrate that the conserved CyaB-cAMP/Vfr pathway 
      controls cytotoxicity of outlier clinical strains through direct transcriptional 
      activation of the exlBA operon. Therefore, despite the fact that the type III 
      secretion system and exolysin are mutually exclusive in classical and outlier 
      strains, respectively, these two major virulence determinants share similarities in 
      their mechanisms of regulation.

AB  - We used high hydrostatic pressure as a tool for exploring the conformational 
      landscape of human cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) by electron paramagnetic resonance 
      and fluorescence spectroscopy. Site-directed incorporation of a luminescence 
      resonance energy transfer donor-acceptor pair allowed us to identify a 
      pressure-dependent equilibrium between two states of the enzyme, where an increase 
      in pressure increased the spatial separation between the two distantly located 
      fluorophores. This transition is characterized by volume change (ΔV°) and P1/2 
      values of -36.8 ± 5.0 mL/mol and 1.45 ± 0.33 kbar, respectively, which corresponds 
      to a Keq° of 0.13 ± 0.06, so that only 15% of the enzyme adopts the 
      pressure-promoted conformation at ambient pressure. This pressure-promoted 
      displacement of the equilibrium is eliminated by the addition of testosterone, an 
      allosteric activator. Using site-directed spin labeling, we demonstrated that the 
      pressure- and testosterone-sensitive transition is also revealed by pressure-induced 
      changes in the electron paramagnetic resonance spectra of a nitroxide side chain 
      placed at position 85 or 409 of the enzyme. Furthermore, we observed a 
      pressure-induced displacement of the emission maxima of a solvatochromic fluorophore 
      (7-diethylamino-3-((((2-maleimidyl)ethyl)amino)carbonyl) coumarin) placed at the 
      same positions, which suggests a relocation to a more polar environment. Taken 
      together, the results reveal an effector-dependent conformational equilibrium 
      between open and closed states of CYP3A4 that involves a pronounced change at the 
      interface between the region of α-helices A/A' and the meander loop of the enzyme, 
      where residues 85 and 409 are located. Our study demonstrates the high potential of 
      pressure-perturbation strategies for studying protein conformational landscapes.

AB  - The design, synthesis, and DNA binding properties of azaHx-PI or 
      p-anisyl-4-aza-benzimidazole-pyrrole-imidazole (5) are described. AzaHx, 
      2-(p-anisyl)-4-aza-benzimidazole-5-carboxamide, is a novel, fluorescent DNA 
      recognition element, derived from Hoechst 33258 to recognize G·C base pairs. 
      Supported by theoretical data, the results from DNase I footprinting, CD, ΔT(M), and 
      SPR studies provided evidence that an azaHx/IP pairing, formed from antiparallel 
      stacking of two azaHx-PI molecules in a side-by-side manner in the minor groove, 
      selectively recognized a C-G doublet. AzaHx-PI was found to target 5'-ACGCGT-3', the 
      Mlu1 Cell Cycle Box (MCB) promoter sequence with specificity and significant 
      affinity (K(eq) 4.0±0.2×10(7) M(-1)).

      Catalytic Efficiency.
PG  - 16292-303
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M115.653287 [doi]
AB  - DNA polymerase ν (pol ν) is a low fidelity A-family polymerase with a putative role 
      in interstrand cross-link repair and homologous recombination. We carried out 
      pre-steady-state kinetic analysis to elucidate the kinetic mechanism of this enzyme. 
      We found that the mechanism consists of seven steps, similar that of other A-family 
      polymerases. pol ν binds to DNA with a Kd for DNA of 9.2 nm, with an off-rate 
      constant of 0.013 s(-1)and an on-rate constant of 14 μm(-1) s(-1). dNTP binding is 
      rapid with Kd values of 20 and 476 μm for the correct and incorrect dNTP, 
      respectively. Pyrophosphorylation occurs with a Kd value for PPi of 3.7 mm and a 
      maximal rate constant of 11 s(-1). Pre-steady-state kinetics, examination of the 
      elemental effect using dNTPαS, and pulse-chase experiments indicate that a rapid 
      phosphodiester bond formation step is flanked by slow conformational changes for 
      both correct and incorrect base pair formation. These experiments in combination 
      with computer simulations indicate that the first conformational change occurs with 
      rate constants of 75 and 20 s(-1); rapid phosphodiester bond formation occurs with a 
      Keq of 2.2 and 1.7, and the second conformational change occurs with rate constants 
      of 2.1 and 0.5 s(-1), for correct and incorrect base pair formation, respectively. 
      The presence of a mispair does not induce the polymerase to adopt a low catalytic 
      conformation. pol ν catalyzes both correct and mispair formation with high catalytic 
      efficiency.

TI  - Solvent-Dependent Pyranopterin Cyclization in Molybdenum Cofactor Model Complexes.
PG  - 8214-22
LID - 10.1021/acs.inorgchem.5b00532 [doi]
AB  - The conserved pterin dithiolene ligand that coordinates molybdenum (Mo) in the 
      cofactor (Moco) of mononuclear Mo enzymes can exist in both a tricyclic pyranopterin 
      dithiolene form and as a bicyclic pterin-dithiolene form as observed in protein 
      crystal structures of several bacterial molybdoenzymes. Interconversion between the 
      tricyclic and bicyclic forms via pyran scission and cyclization has been 
      hypothesized to play a role in the catalytic mechanism of Moco. Therefore, 
      understanding the interconversion between the tricyclic and bicyclic forms, a type 
      of ring-chain tautomerism, is an important aspect of study to understand its role in 
      catalysis. In this study, equilibrium constants (K(eq)) as well as enthalpy, 
      entropy, and free energy values are obtained for pyran ring tautomerism exhibited by 
      two Moco model complexes, namely, (Et4N)[Tp*Mo(O)(S2BMOPP)] (1) and 
      (Et4N)[Tp*Mo(O)(S2PEOPP)] (2), as a solvent-dependent equilibrium process. Keq 
      values obtained from (1)H NMR data in seven deuterated solvents show a correlation 
      between solvent polarity and tautomer form, where solvents with higher polarity 
      parameters favor the pyran form.

AB  - Current interest in copper/dioxygen reactivity includes the influence of thioether 
      sulfur ligation, as it concerns the formation, structures, and properties of derived 
      copper-dioxygen complexes. Here, we report on the chemistry of {L-Cu(I)}2-(O2) 
      species L = (DMM)ESE, (DMM)ESP, and (DMM)ESDP, which are N3S(thioether)-based 
      ligands varied in the nature of a substituent on the S atom, along with a related 
      N3O(ether) (EOE) ligand. Cu(I) and Cu(II) complexes have been synthesized and 
      crystallographically characterized. Copper(I) complexes are dimeric in the solid 
      state, [{L-Cu(I)}2](B(C6F5)4)2, however are shown by diffusion-ordered NMR 
      spectroscopy to be mononuclear in solution. Copper(II) complexes with a general 
      formulation [L-Cu(II)(X)](n+) {X = ClO4(-), n = 1, or X = H2O, n = 2} exhibit 
      distorted square pyramidal coordination geometries and progressively weaker axial 
      thioether ligation across the series. Oxygenation (-130 °C) of {((DMM)ESE)Cu(I)}(+) 
      results in the formation of a trans-μ-1,2-peroxodicopper(II) species 
      [{((DMM)ESE)Cu(II)}2(μ-1,2-O2(2-))](2+) (1(P)). Weakening the Cu-S bond via a change 
      to the thioether donor found in (DMM)ESP leads to the initial formation of 
      [{((DMM)ESP)Cu(II)}2(μ-1,2-O2(2-))](2+) (2(P)) that subsequently isomerizes to a 
      bis-μ-oxodicopper(III) complex, [{((DMM)ESP)Cu(III)}2(μ-O(2-))2](2+) (2(O)), with 
      2(P) and 2(O) in equilibrium (K(eq) = [2(O)]/[2(P)] = 2.6 at -130 °C). Formulations 
      for these Cu/O2 adducts were confirmed by resonance Raman (rR) spectroscopy. This 
      solution mixture is sensitive to the addition of methylsulfonate, which shifts the 
      equilibrium toward the bis-μ-oxo isomer. Further weakening of the Cu-S bond in 
      (DMM)ESDP or substitution with an ether donor in (DMM)EOE leads to only a bis-μ-oxo 
      species (3(O) and 4(O), respectively). Reactivity studies indicate that the 
      bis-μ-oxodicopper(III) species (2(O), 3(O)) and not the trans-peroxo isomers (1(P) 
      and 2(P)) are responsible for the observed ligand sulfoxidation. Our findings 
      concerning the existence of the 2(P)/2(O) equilibrium contrast with previously 
      established ligand-Cu(I)/O2 reactivity and possible implications are discussed.

TI  - Charge-pairing interactions control the conformational setpoint and motions of the 
      FMN domain in neuronal nitric oxide synthase.
PG  - 607-17
LID - 10.1042/BJ20121488 [doi]
AB  - The NOS (nitric oxide synthase; EC 1.14.13.39) enzymes contain a C-terminal 
      flavoprotein domain [NOSred (reductase domain of NOS)] that binds FAD and FMN, and 
      an N-terminal oxygenase domain that binds haem. Evidence suggests that the 
      FMN-binding domain undergoes large conformational motions to shuttle electrons 
      between the NADPH/FAD-binding domain [FNR (ferredoxin NADP-reductase)] and the 
      oxygenase domain. Previously we have shown that three residues on the FMN domain 
      (Glu762, Glu816 and Glu819) that make charge-pairing interactions with the FNR help 
      to slow electron flux through nNOSred (neuronal NOSred). In the present study, we 
      show that charge neutralization or reversal at each of these residues alters the 
      setpoint [Keq(A)] of the NOSred conformational equilibrium to favour the open 
      (FMN-deshielded) conformational state. Moreover, computer simulations of the kinetic 
      traces of cytochrome c reduction by the mutants suggest that they have higher 
      conformational transition rates (1.5-4-fold) and rates of interflavin electron 
      transfer (1.5-2-fold) relative to wild-type nNOSred. We conclude that the three 
      charge-pairing residues on the FMN domain govern electron flux through nNOSred by 
      stabilizing its closed (FMN-shielded) conformational state and by retarding the rate 
      of conformational switching between its open and closed conformations.

TI  - UDP-glucuronic acid binds first and the aglycone substrate binds second to form a 
      ternary complex in UGT1A9-catalyzed reactions, in both the presence and absence of 
      bovine serum albumin.
PG  - 2192-203
LID - 10.1124/dmd.112.047746 [doi]
AB  - The presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) largely modulates the enzyme kinetics 
      parameters of the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9, increasing both the 
      apparent aglycone substrate affinity of the enzyme and its limiting reaction 
      velocity (Drug Metab Dispos 39:2117-2129, 2011). For a better understanding of the 
      BSA effects and an examination of whether its presence changes the catalytic 
      mechanism, we have studied the enzyme kinetics of 4-methylumbelliferone 
      glucuronidation by UGT1A9 in the presence and absence of 0.1% BSA, using bisubstrate 
      enzyme kinetic experiments, in both the forward and reverse directions, as well as 
      product and dead-end inhibition. The combined results strongly suggest that the 
      reaction mechanism of UGT1A9, and presumably other human UGTs as well, involves the 
      formation of a compulsory-order ternary-complex, with UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid 
      (UDPGA) as the first binding substrate. Based on the enzyme kinetic parameters 
      measured for the forward and reverse reactions, the equilibrium constant of the 
      overall reaction was calculated (Keq = 574) and the relative magnitudes of the 
      reaction rate constants were elucidated. The inclusion of BSA in the bisubstrate 
      kinetic experiments quantitatively changed the apparent enzyme kinetic parameters, 
      presumably by removing internal inhibitors that bind to the binary enzyme-UDPGA 
      (E-UDPGA) complex, as well as to the ternary E-UDPGA-aglycone complex. Nevertheless, 
      the underlying compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism with UDPGA binding first 
      is the same in both the absence and presence of BSA. The results offer a novel 
      understanding of UGT enzyme kinetic mechanism and BSA effects.

AB  - Fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA) is a useful biocatalyst with potential 
      applications in chiral synthesis. In this study, the overall kinetic mechanism of 
      FucA from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii was studied. The K(m) values of 
      dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and dl-glyceraldehyde were 0.09 and 0.74 mM, 
      respectively. Dead-end inhibition by trimethyl phosphonoacetate and dl-threose were 
      competitive and uncompetitive with respect to DHAP and dl-glyceraldehyde. Inhibition 
      patterns obtained using reaction products were noncompetitive vs. DHAP and 
      competitive vs. dl-glyceraldehyde. The equilibrium constant was 8.309×10(-3) M as 
      assessed by varying the [DHAP]/[product] ratio at a fixed dl-glyceraldehyde 
      concentration and by measuring the change in DHAP concentration after equilibrium 
      was reached. This constant is consistent with the K(eq) value obtained from (13)C 
      NMR (15.625×10(-3) M). The resultant inhibition kinetics may suggest the insights of 
      kinetic mechanism of the FucA catalyzed reaction.

AB  - Kinetic modeling of metabolism holds great potential for metabolic engineering but 
      is hindered by the gap between model complexity and availability of in vivo data. 
      There is also growing interest in network-wide thermodynamic analyses, which are 
      currently limited by the scarcity and unreliability of thermodynamic reference data. 
      Here we propose an in vivo data-driven approach to simultaneously address both 
      problems. We then demonstrate the procedure in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using 
      chemostats to generate a large flux/metabolite dataset, under 32 conditions spanning 
      a large range of fluxes. Reactions were classified as pseudo-, near- or 
      far-from-equilibrium, allowing the complexity of mathematical description to be 
      tailored to the kinetic behavior displayed in vivo. For 3/4 of the reactions we 
      derived fully in vivo-parameterized kinetic descriptions which can be readily 
      incorporated into models. For near-equilibrium reactions this involved a new 
      simplified format, dubbed "Q-linear kinetics". We also demonstrate, for the first 
      time, systematic estimation of apparent in vivo K(eq) values. Remarkably, comparison 
      with E. coli data suggests they constitute a suitable in vivo interspecies 
      thermodynamic reference.

TI  - Real time detection of lysozyme by pulsed streaming potentials using polyclonal 
      antibodies immobilized on a renewable nonfouling surface inside plastic microfluidic 
      channels.
PG  - 2012-9
LID - 10.1021/ac102769j [doi]
AB  - A composite surface was prepared on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) microchannels by 
      UV-photografting of polyethylene glycol acrylate (PEGA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) 
      films. A PEGA layer of globular particles with average thickness of 60 nm was formed 
      after 15 min of polymerization. Real time monitoring by pulsed streaming potentials 
      demonstrated the ability of the PEGA layer to inhibit the adhesion of five different 
      nonspecific adsorbing proteins when compared with pristine COC. Roughness determined 
      by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after PAA grafting on COC-PEGA at different UV 
      illumination times suggests that PAA formation is initiated at the free space in 
      between the PEGA particles. Carboxylic groups activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide 
      and N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide were used to bind anti-lysozyme 
      polyclonal antibodies. The composite COC-PEGA-PAA-anti-lysozyme surface demonstrated 
      its ability to detect lysozyme with a dynamic range between 140 and 860 nM. 
      Linearity was maintained even when samples were spiked with 250 nM of cytochrome as 
      interfering species. The equilibrium constant K(eq) for the adsorption of Ly on 
      COC-PEGA-PAA-anti-Ly was estimated to be 2.7 × 10(6) M(-1), and it shows that this 
      kinetic approach of monitoring the surface charge is also useful to estimate 
      affinity interactions for proteins in label free fashion. The regeneration of the 
      surface exhibited an average percentage of recovery of ∼97% for each of six 
      adsorption-regeneration cycles. This feature enables curve calibration on a single 
      microfluidic chip because each point of the curve has a reproducible and renewable 
      surface.

TI  - The tightly bound calcium of MauG is required for tryptophan tryptophylquinone 
      cofactor biosynthesis.
PG  - 144-50
AB  - The diheme enzyme MauG catalyzes a six-electron oxidation required for 
      posttranslational modification of a precursor of methylamine dehydrogenase (preMADH) 
      to complete the biosynthesis of its protein-derived tryptophan tryptophylquinone 
      (TTQ) cofactor. The crystal structure of the MauG-preMADH complex revealed the 
      presence of a Ca(2+) in proximity to the two hemes [Jensen, L. M. R., Sanishvili, 
      R., Davidson, V. L., and Wilmot, C. M. (2010) Science 327, 1392-1394]. This Ca(2+) 
      did not readily dissociate; however, after extensive treatment with EGTA or EDTA 
      MauG was no longer able to catalyze TTQ biosynthesis and exhibited altered 
      absorption and resonance Raman spectra. The changes in spectral features are 
      consistent with Ca(2+)-dependent changes in heme spin state and conformation. 
      Addition of H(2)O(2) to the Ca(2+)-depleted MauG did not yield spectral changes 
      characteristic of formation of the bis-Fe(IV) state which is stabilized in native 
      MauG. After addition of Ca(2+) to the Ca(2+)-depleted MauG, full TTQ biosynthesis 
      activity and reactivity toward H(2)O(2) were restored, and the spectral properties 
      returned to those of native MauG. Kinetic and equilibrium studies of Ca(2+) binding 
      to Ca(2+)-depleted MauG indicated a two-step mechanism. Ca(2+) initially reversibly 
      binds to Ca(2+)-depleted MauG (K(d) = 22.4 μM) and is followed by a relatively slow 
      (k = 1.4 × 10(-3) s(-1)) but highly favorable (K(eq) = 4.2) conformational change, 
      yielding an equilibrium dissociation constant K(d,eq) value of 5.3 μM. The circular 
      dichroism spectra of native and Ca(2+)-depleted MauG were essentially the same, 
      consistent with Ca(2+)-induced conformational changes involving domain or loop 
      movements rather than general unfolding or alteration of secondary structure. These 
      results are discussed in the context of the structures of MauG and heme-containing 
      peroxidases.

AB  - The synthesis, DNA binding characteristics and biological activity of an N-formamido 
      pyrrole- and imidazole-containing H-pin polyamide (f-PIP H-pin, 2) designed to 
      selectively target the ICB2 site on the topoIIalpha promoter, is reported herein. 
      Thermal denaturation, circular dichroism, isothermal titration calorimetry, surface 
      plasmon resonance and DNase I footprinting studies demonstrated that 2 maintained 
      the selectivity of the unlinked parent monomer f-PIP (1) and with a slight 
      enhancement in binding affinity (K(eq)=5 x 10(5)M(-1)) to the cognate site 
      (5'-TACGAT-3'). H-pin 2 also exhibited comparable ability to inhibit NF-Y binding to 
      1, as demonstrated by gel shift studies. However, in stark contrast to monomer 1, 
      the H-pin did not affect the up-regulation of topoisomerase IIalpha (topoIIalpha) in 
      cells (Western blot), suggesting that the H-pin does not enter the nucleus. This 
      study is the first to the authors' knowledge that reports such a markedly different 
      cellular response between two compounds of almost identical binding characteristics.

TI  - Site-directed mutagenesis of rice serine racemase: evidence that Glu219 and Asp225 
      mediate the effects of Mg2+ on the activity.
PG  - 1579-90

AB  - We succeeded in constructing the Glu219Ala/Asp225Ala (i.e., E219A/D225A) serine 
      racemase (SerR) by site-directed mutagenesis, and the effects of Mg(2+) on the 
      catalytic efficiency and the structure were compared between the E219A/D225A-SerR 
      and the wild-type protein. This is the first example of a serine racemase whose 
      amino acid residues in the Mg(2+)-binding site were replaced with other amino acids 
      by site-directed mutagenesis. Neither the serine racemase nor the dehydratase 
      activities of the E219A/D225A-SerR were affected by the addition of Mg(2+), and 
      Glu219 and Asp225 of the SerR are the essential amino acid residues for Mg(2+) to 
      affect both kinds of enzyme activities. Therefore, Glu219 and Asp225 mediate the 
      effects of Mg(2+) on the activity and are important for the SerR to form the 
      Mg(2+)-binding site. Judging from the difference of the K(eq) values between the 
      E219A/D225A-SerR and the SerR, Mg(2+) might affect the equilibrium states in the 
      racemase reaction. The fluorescence quenching analysis of the E219A/D225A-SerR 
      showed that Mg(2+) bound to Glu219 and Asp225 of the SerR probably causes a 
      conformational change in the ternary structure of the SerR.

TI  - The human estrogen sulfotransferase: a half-site reactive enzyme.
PG  - 4779-85
LID - 10.1021/bi902190r [doi]
AB  - The affinity of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) for the estrogen receptor is weakened beyond 
      the point of physiological relevance by the transfer of the sulfuryl moiety (-SO(3)) 
      from PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate) to the 3'-hydroxyl of E(2). The 
      mechanism of this transfer reaction, catalyzed by estrogen sulfotransferase (EST), 
      is investigated here in detail. The enzyme (a dimer of identical protomers) presents 
      a clear example of half-sites reactivity--only one of the subunits of the dimer 
      produces product during the catalytic cycle. This is the first example of half-sites 
      reactivity in the sulfotransferase family. A burst of product, with an amplitude 
      that corresponds to one-half of the available active sites, reveals that the 
      mechanism is rate-limited by product release. The equilibrium constant governing 
      interconversion of the substrate (E.PAPS.E(2)) and product (E.PAP.E(2)S) central 
      complexes was determined and is strongly biased toward product (K(eq int) 
      approximately 49). Slow product release allows the interconversion of the central 
      complexes to approach equilibrium, with the result that K(eq int) becomes nearly 
      linearly coupled to K(m) and contributes a factor of approximately 30 to the 
      steady-state affinity of the enzyme for substrate. Typical of its family, estrogen 
      sulfotransferase is partially k(cat)-inhibited by its acceptor substrate, E(2). This 
      inhibition does not influence the burst kinetics and thus occurs after formation of 
      the product central complex, a finding consistent with the slow escape of PAP from 
      the nonreactive E.PAP.E(2) complex.

TI  - Phosphorylation of the transcription factor Ets-1 by ERK2: rapid dissociation of ADP 
      and phospho-Ets-1.
PG  - 3619-30
LID - 10.1021/bi100199q [doi]
AB  - ERK2, a major effector of the BRAF oncogene, is a promiscuous protein kinase that 
      has a strong preference for phosphorylating substrates on Ser-Pro or Thr-Pro motifs. 
      As part of a program to understand the fundamental basis for ERK2 substrate 
      recognition and catalysis, we have studied the mechanism by which ERK2 
      phosphorylates the transcription factor Ets-1 at Thr-38. A feature of the mechanism 
      in the forward direction is a partially rate-limiting product release step (koff = 
      59 +/- 6 s(-1)), which is significant because to approach maximum efficiency 
      substrates for ERK2 may evolve to ensure that ADP dissociation is rate-limiting. To 
      improve our understanding of the mechanism of product release, the binding of the 
      products to ERK2 was assessed and the reaction was examined in the reverse 
      direction. These studies demonstrated that phospho-Ets-1 (p-Ets) binds >20-fold more 
      tightly to ERK2 than ADP (Kd = 7.3 and 165 microM, respectively) and revealed that 
      the products exhibit little interaction energetically while bound to ERK2 and that 
      they can dissociate ERK2 in a random order. The overall equilibrium for the reaction 
      in solution (Keq = 250 M(-1)) was found to be similar to that with the substrate 
      bound to the enzyme (Kint = 525 M(-1)). To determine what limits koff, several 
      pre-steady-state experiments were performed. A catalytic trapping approach furnished 
      a rate constant (k-ADPa) of 61 +/- 12 s(-1) for the dissociation of ADP from the 
      abortive ternary complex, ERK2.Ets.ADP. To examine p-Ets dissociation, the binding 
      of a fluorescent derivative (p-Ets-F), which binds ERK2 with an affinity similar to 
      that of p-Ets, was examined by stopped-flow kinetics. Using this approach, p-Ets-F 
      was found to bind through a single-step mechanism, with the following parameters: 
      k-p-Ets-F = 121 +/- 3.8 s(-1), and kp-Ets-F = (9.4 +/- 0.3) X 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). 
      Similar results were found in the presence of a saturating ADP concentration. These 
      data suggest that koff may be limited by the dissociation of both products and are 
      consistent with the notion that Ets-1 has evolved to be an efficient substrate for 
      ERK2, where ADP release is, at least, partially rate-limiting. A molecular mechanics 
      model of the complex formed between ERK2 and residues 28-138 of Ets-1 provides 
      insight into the role of substrate docking interactions.

AB  - Archaea synthesize isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate 
      (DMAPP), the essential building blocks of isoprenoid compounds, from mevalonate 
      (MVA). However, an analysis of the genomes of several members of the Archaea failed 
      to identify genes for the enzymes required to convert phosphomevalonate (PM) to IPP 
      in eukaryotes. The recent discovery of an isopentenyl kinase (IPK) in 
      Methanocaldococcus jannaschii (MJ) suggests a new variation of the MVA pathway where 
      PM is decarboxylated to give isopentenyl phosphate (IP), which is phosphorylated to 
      produce IPP. A blast search using the MJ protein as a probe revealed a subfamily of 
      amino acid kinases that include the fosfomycin resistance protein fomA, which 
      deactivates the antibiotic by phosphorylation of its phosphonate residue in a 
      reaction similar to the conversion of IP to IPP. IPK genes were cloned from two 
      organisms identified in the search, Methanothermobacter thermautotrophicus (MTH) and 
      Thermoplasma acidophilum (THA), and the His-tagged recombinant proteins were 
      purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. The enzymes catalyze the reversible 
      phosphorylation of IP by ATP, K(eq) = 6.3 +/- 1. The catalytic efficiencies (V/K) of 
      the proteins were approximately 2 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1). In the reverse direction, ADP 
      was a substrate inhibitor for THA IPK, K(i)(ADP) = 58 +/- 6 microM, but not for MTH 
      IPK. Both enzymes were active over a broad range of pH and temperature. Five 
      compounds, dimethylallyl phosphate, isopentenyl thiolophosphate, 1-butyl phosphate, 
      3-buten-1-yl phosphate, and geranyl phosphate, were evaluated as alternative 
      substrates for the MTH and THA IP kinases. All of the compounds were phosphorylated, 
      although the catalytic efficiency was low for geranyl phosphate.

TI  - Intramolecular electron transfer in sulfite-oxidizing enzymes: elucidating the role 
      of a conserved active site arginine.
PG  - 2156-63
LID - 10.1021/bi801553q [doi]
AB  - All reported sulfite-oxidizing enzymes have a conserved arginine in their active 
      site which hydrogen bonds to the equatorial oxygen ligand on the Mo atom. Previous 
      studies on the pathogenic R160Q mutant of human sulfite oxidase (HSO) have shown 
      that Mo-heme intramolecular electron transfer (IET) is dramatically slowed when 
      positive charge is lost at this position. To improve our understanding of the 
      function that this conserved positively charged residue plays in IET, we have 
      studied the equivalent uncharged substitutions R55Q and R55M as well as the 
      positively charged substitution R55K in bacterial sulfite dehydrogenase (SDH). The 
      heme and molybdenum cofactor (Moco) subunits are tightly associated in SDH, which 
      makes it an ideal system for improving our understanding of residue function in IET 
      without the added complexity of the interdomain movement that occurs in HSO. 
      Unexpectedly, the uncharged SDH variants (R55Q and R55M) exhibited increased IET 
      rate constants relative to that of the wild type (3-4-fold) when studied by laser 
      flash photolysis. The gain in function observed in SDH(R55Q) and SDH(R55M) suggests 
      that the reduction in the level of IET seen in HSO(R160Q) is not due to a required 
      role of this residue in the IET pathway itself, but to the fact that it plays an 
      important role in heme orientation during the interdomain movement necessary for IET 
      in HSO (as seen in viscosity experiments). The pH profiles of SDH(WT), SDH(R55M), 
      and SDH(R55Q) show that the arginine substitution also alters the behavior of the 
      Mo-heme IET equilibrium (K(eq)) and rate constants (k(et)) of both variants with 
      respect to the SDH(WT) enzyme. SDH(WT) has a k(et) that is independent of pH and a 
      K(eq) that increases as pH decreases; on the other hand, both SDH(R55M) and 
      SDH(R55Q) have a k(et) that increases as pH decreases, and SDH(R55M) has a K(eq) 
      that is pH-independent. IET in the SDH(R55Q) variant is inhibited by sulfate in 
      laser flash photolysis experiments, a behavior that differs from that of SDH(WT), 
      but which also occurs in HSO. IET in SDH(R55K) is slower than in SDH(WT). A new 
      analysis of the possible mechanistic pathways for sulfite-oxidizing enzymes is 
      presented and related to available kinetic and EPR results for these enzymes.

TI  - Loop-tryptophan human purine nucleoside phosphorylase reveals submillisecond protein 
      dynamics.
PG  - 3658-68
LID - 10.1021/bi802339c [doi]
AB  - Human PNP is a homotrimer containing three tryptophan residues at positions 16, 94, 
      and 178, all remote from the catalytic site. The catalytic sites of PNP are located 
      near the subunit-subunit interfaces where F159 is a catalytic site residue donated 
      from an adjacent subunit. F159 covers the top (beta) surface of the ribosyl group at 
      the catalytic site. QM/MM calculations of human PNP have shown that F159 is the 
      center of the most mobile region of the protein providing access to the substrate in 
      the active site. F159 is also the key residue in a cluster of hydrophobic residues 
      that shield catalytic site ligands from bulk solvent. Trp-free human PNP (Leuko-PNP) 
      was previously engineered by replacing the three Trp residues of native PNP with 
      Tyr. From this active construct, a single Trp residue was placed in the catalytic 
      site loop (F159W-Leuko-PNP) as a reporter group for the ribosyl region of the 
      catalytic site. The F159W-Leuko-PNP fluorescence is red shifted compared to native 
      PNP, suggesting a solvent-exposed Trp residue. Upon ligand binding (hypoxanthine), 
      the 3-fold fluorescence quench confirms conformational packing of the catalytic site 
      pocket hydrophobic cluster. F159W-Leuko-PNP has an on-enzyme thermodynamic 
      equilibrium constant (Keq) near unity in the temperature range between 20 and 30 
      degrees C and nonzero enthalpic components, making it suitable for laser-induced 
      T-jump analyses. T-jump relaxation kinetics of F159W-Leuko-PNP in equilibrium with 
      substrates and/or products indicate the conformational equilibria of at least two 
      ternary complex intermediates in the nano- to millisecond time scale (1000-10000 
      s-1) that equilibrate prior to the slower chemical step (approximately 200 s-1). 
      F159W-Leuko-PNP provides a novel protein platform to investigate the protein 
      conformational dynamics occurring prior to transition state formation.

AB  - The five-coordinate iron-dithiolate complex 
      (N,N'-4,7-bis-(2'-methyl-2'-mercatopropyl)-1-thia-4,7-diazacyclononane)iron(III), 
      [LFe]+, has been isolated as the triflate salt from reaction of the previously 
      reported LFeCl with thallium triflate. Spectroscopic characterization confirms an S 
      = 1/2 ground state in non-coordinating solvents with room temperature microeff = 
      1.78 microB and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) derived g-values of g1 = 2.04, 
      g2 = 2.02 and g3 = 2.01. [LFe]+ binds a variety of coordinating solvents resulting 
      in six-coordinate complexes [LFe-solvent]+. In acetonitrile the low-spin [LFe-NCMe]+ 
      (g1 = 2.27, g2 = 2.18, and g3 = 1.98) is in equilibrium with [LFe]+ with a binding 
      constant of Keq = 4.7 at room temperature. Binding of H2O, DMF, methanol, DMSO, and 
      pyridine to [LFe]+ yields high-spin six-coordinate complexes with EPR spectra that 
      display significant strain in the rhombic zero-field splitting term E/D. Addition of 
      1 equiv of triflic acid to the previously reported diiron species (LFe)2O results in 
      the formation of [(LFe)2OH]OTf, which has been characterized by X-ray 
      crystallography. The aqueous chemistry of [LFe]+ reveals three distinct species as a 
      function of pH: [LFe-OH2]+, [(LFe)2OH]OTf, and (LFe)2O. The pKa values for 
      [LFe-OH2]+ and [(LFe)2OH]OTf are 5.4 +/- 0.1 and 6.52 +/- 0.05, respectively.

TI  - Synthetic peptides as artificial receptors towards proteins from genetically 
      modified organisms.

AB  - The aim of this work was the preparation of peptide ligands with good affinity and 
      selectivity towards proteins from genetically modified organisms, namely neomycin 
      phosphotransferase II (Npt II) and the endotoxin Cry1A. A 12 x 12 combinatorial 
      solid phase synthesis in aqueous medium was performed to prepare peptide libraries. 
      From this library, two dipeptides with binding properties towards the chosen ligands 
      (Pro-Lys for Npt II, K(eq) 7.59 x 10(4)M(-1); Trp-Gln for Cry 1A, K(eq) 4.35 x 
      10(4)M(-1)) were selected as scaffolds for the synthesis of new tetrapeptide 
      libraries. The equilibrium constants of the newly selected tetrapeptides increased 
      slightly respect to the dipeptides (Pro-Lys-His-Phe for Npt II, K(eq) 7.88 x 
      10(4)M(-1); Trp-Gln-Ala-Phe for Cry 1A, K(eq) 5.65 x 10(4)M(-1)), but selectivity 
      towards other proteins (wheat gliadins, bovine gamma-globulins, bovine serum albumin 
      and chicken ovalbumin) became higher. It was demonstrated that selected 
      tetrapeptides recognised well the ligands also in presence of very complex mixtures 
      of potentially interfering proteins, such as whole cell lysates. This approach can 
      be considered as a general method to obtain tailor-made reagents with antibody-like 
      binding properties towards biomacromolecules.

TI  - Metabolism of the folate precursor p-aminobenzoate in plants: glucose ester 
      formation and vacuolar storage.
PG  - 15451-9
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M709591200 [doi]
AB  - Plants produce p-aminobenzoate (pABA) in chloroplasts and use it for folate 
      synthesis in mitochondria. In plant tissues, however, pABA is known to occur 
      predominantly as its glucose ester (pABA-Glc), and the role of this metabolite in 
      folate synthesis has not been defined. In this study, the UDP-glucose:pABA 
      acyl-glucosyltransferase (pAGT) activity in Arabidopsis extracts was found to reside 
      principally (95%) in one isoform with an apparent K(m) for pABA of 0.12 mm. 
      Screening of recombinant Arabidopsis UDP-glycosyltransferases identified only three 
      that recognized pABA. One of these (UGT75B1) exhibited a far higher k(cat)/K(m) 
      value than the others and a far lower apparent K(m) for pABA (0.12 mm), suggesting 
      its identity with the principal enzyme in vivo. Supporting this possibility, 
      ablation of UGT75B1 reduced extractable pAGT activity by 95%, in vivo [(14)C]pABA 
      glucosylation by 77%, and the endogenous pABA-Glc/pABA ratio by 9-fold. The K(eq) 
      for the pABA esterification reaction was found to be 3 x 10(-3). Taken with 
      literature data on the cytosolic location of pAGT activity and on cytosolic 
      UDP-glucose/UDP ratios, this K(eq) value allowed estimation that only 4% of 
      cytosolic pABA is esterified. That pABA-Glc predominates in planta therefore implies 
      that it is sequestered away from the cytosol and, consistent with this possibility, 
      vacuoles isolated from [(14)C]pABA-fed pea leaves were estimated to contain> or =88% 
      of the [(14)C]pABA-Glc formed. In total, these data and the fact that isolated 
      mitochondria did not take up [(3)H]pABA-Glc, suggest that the glucose ester 
      represents a storage form of pABA that does not contribute directly to folate 
      synthesis.

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of the metabolome of Pseudomonas putida S12 grown on 
      different carbon sources.
PG  - 315-27
LID - 10.1039/b717340g [doi]
AB  - Metabolomics is an emerging, powerful, functional genomics technology that involves 
      the comparative non-targeted analysis of the complete set of metabolites in an 
      organism. We have set-up a robust quantitative metabolomics platform that allows the 
      analysis of 'snapshot' metabolomes. In this study, we have applied this platform for 
      the comprehensive analysis of the metabolite composition of Pseudomonas putida S12 
      grown on four different carbon sources, i.e. fructose, glucose, gluconate and 
      succinate. This paper focuses on the microbial aspects of analyzing comprehensive 
      metabolomes, and demonstrates that metabolomes can be analyzed reliably. The 
      technical (i.e. sample work-up and analytical) reproducibility was on average 10%, 
      while the biological reproducibility was approximately 40%. Moreover, the energy 
      charge values of the microbial samples generated were determined, and indicated that 
      no biotic or abiotic changes had occurred during sample work-up and analysis. In 
      general, the metabolites present and their concentrations were very similar after 
      growth on the different carbon sources. However, specific metabolites showed large 
      differences in concentration, especially the intermediates involved in the 
      degradation of the carbon sources studied. Principal component discriminant analysis 
      was applied to identify metabolites that are specific for, i.e. not necessarily the 
      metabolites that show those largest differences in concentration, cells grown on 
      either of these four carbon sources. For selected enzymatic reactions, i.e. the 
      glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase 
      reactions, the apparent equilibrium constants (K(app)) were calculated. In several 
      instances a carbon source-dependent deviation between the apparent equilibrium 
      constant (K(app)) and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (K(eq)) was observed, 
      hinting towards a potential point of metabolic regulation or towards bottlenecks in 
      biosynthesis routes. For glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase, the 
      K(app) was larger than K(eq), and the results suggested that the specific enzymatic 
      activities of these two enzymes were too low to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium 
      in growing cells. In contrast, with triosephosphate isomerase the K(app) was smaller 
      than K(eq), and the results suggested that this enzyme is kinetically controlled.

TI  - Modifying the N-terminus of polyamides: PyImPyIm has improved sequence specificity 
      over f-ImPyIm.
PG  - 5266-76
LID - 10.1016/j.bmc.2008.03.008 [doi]
AB  - Seven N-terminus modified derivatives of a previously published minor-groove binding 
      polyamide (f-ImPyIm, 1) were synthesized and the biochemical and biophysical 
      chemistry evaluated. These compounds were synthesized with the aim of attaining a 
      higher level of sequence selectivity over f-ImPyIm (1), a previously published 
      strong minor-groove binder. Two compounds possessing a furan or a benzofuran moiety 
      at the N-terminus showed a footprint of 0.5microM at the cognate ACGCGT site 
      (determined by DNase I footprinting); however, the specificity of these compounds 
      was not improved. In contrast, PyImPyIm (4) produced a footprint of 0.5microM but 
      showed a superior specificity using the same technique. When evaluated by thermal 
      melting experiments and circular dichroism using ACGCGT and the non-cognate AAATTT 
      sequence, all compounds were shown to bind in the minor-groove of DNA and stabilize 
      the cognate sequence much better than the non-cognate (except for the 
      non-amido-compound that did not bind either sequence, as expected). PyImPyIm (4) was 
      interesting as the DeltaT(m) for this compound was only 4 degrees C but the 
      footprint was very selective. No binding was observed for this compound with a third 
      DNA (non-cognate, ACCGGT). ITC studies on compound 4 showed exothermic binding with 
      ACGCGT and no heat change was observed for titrating the compound to the other two 
      DNA sequences. The heat capacity (DeltaC(p)) of the PIPI/ACGCGT complex calculated 
      from the hydrophobic interactions and SASA calculations was comparable to the 
      experimental value obtained from ITC (-146calmol(-1)K(-1)). SPR results provided 
      confirmation of the sequence specificity of PyImPyIm (4), with a K(eq) value 
      determined to be 7.1x10(6) M(-1) for the cognate sequence and no observable binding 
      to AAATTT and ACCGGT. Molecular dynamic simulations affirmed that PyImPyIm (4) binds 
      as a dimer in an overlapped conformation, and it fits snugly in the minor-groove of 
      the ACGCGT oligonucleotide. PyImPyIm (4) is an especially interesting molecule, 
      because although the binding affinity is slightly reduced, the specificity with 
      respect to f-ImPyIm (1) is significantly improved.

TI  - Properties of serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase purified from Arabidopsis thaliana 
      leaves.
PG  - 102-10
AB  - The photorespiratory enzyme L-serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT; EC 2.6.1.45) 
      was purified from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. The final enzyme was approximately 
      80% pure as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
      with silver staining. The identity of the enzyme was confirmed by LC/MS/MS analysis. 
      The molecular mass estimated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-150 
      under non-denaturing conditions, mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization/time of flight technique) and sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 82.4 kDa, 42.0 kDa, and 39.8 kDa, 
      respectively, indicating dimer as the active form. The optimum pH value was 9.2. The 
      enzyme activity was inhibited by aminooxyacetate and beta-chloro-L-alanine both 
      compounds reacting with the carbonyl group of pyridoxal phosphate. The enzyme's 
      transaminating activity with L-alanine and glyoxylate as substrates was 
      approximately 55% of that observed with L-serine and glyoxylate. The lower Km value 
      (1.25 mM) for L-alanine, compared with that of other plant SGATs, and the 
      kcat/Km(Ala) ratio being approximately 2-fold higher than kcat/Km(Ser) suggested 
      that, during photorespiration, Ala and Ser are used by Arabidopsis SGAT with equal 
      efficiency as amino group donors for glyoxylate. The equilibrium constant (Keq), 
      derived from the Haldane relation, for the transamination reaction between L-serine 
      and glyoxylate with the formation of hydroxypyruvate and glycine was 79.1, strongly 
      favoring glycine synthesis. However, it was accompanied by a low Km value of 2.83 mM 
      for glycine. A comparison of some kinetic properties of the studied enzymes with the 
      recombinant Arabidopsis SGATs previously obtained revealed substantial differences. 
      The ratio of the velocity of the transamination reaction with L-alanine and 
      glyoxylate as substrates versus that with L-serine and glyoxylate was 1:1.8 for the 
      native enzyme, whereas it was 1:7 for the recombinant SGAT. Native SGAT showed a 
      much lower Km value for L-alanine compared to the recombinant enzyme.

TI  - Enzymic approach to eurythermalism of Alvinella pompejana and its episymbionts.
PG  - 774-82
AB  - The equilibrium model, which describes the influence of temperature on enzyme 
      activity, has been established as a valid and useful tool for characterizing enzyme 
      eurythermalism and thermophily. By introducing K(eq), a temperature-dependent 
      equilibrium constant for the interconversion between E(act), the active form of 
      enzyme, and E(inact), a reversibly inactive form of enzyme, the equilibrium model 
      currently provides the most complete description of the enzyme-temperature 
      relationship; its derived parameters are intrinsic and apparently universal and, 
      being derived under reaction conditions, potentially have physiological 
      significance. One of these parameters, T(eq), correlates with host growth 
      temperature better than enzyme stability does. The vent-dwelling annelid Alvinella 
      pompejana has been reported as an extremely eurythermal organism, and the symbiotic 
      complex microbial community associated with its dorsal surface is likely to 
      experience similar environmental thermal conditions. The A. pompejana episymbiont 
      community, predominantly composed of epsilonproteobacteria, has been analyzed 
      metagenomically, enabling direct retrieval of genes coding for enzymes suitable for 
      equilibrium model applications. Two such genes, coding for isopropylmalate 
      dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, have been isolated from the A. pompejana 
      episymbionts, heterologously expressed, and shown by reverse 
      transcription-quantitative PCR to be actively expressed. The equilibrium model 
      parameters of characterized expression products suggested that enzyme eurythermalism 
      constitutes part of the thermal adaptation strategy employed by the episymbionts. 
      Moreover, the enzymes' thermal characteristics correspond to their predicted 
      physiological roles and the abundance and expression of the corresponding genes. 
      This paper demonstrates the use of the equilibrium model as part of a top-down 
      metagenomic approach to studying temperature adaptation of uncultured organisms.

TI  - Quantitative effects of allosteric ligands and mutations on conformational 
      equilibria in Salmonella typhimurium tryptophan synthase.
PG  - 8-19
AB  - Allosteric communications are important in coordination of the reactions in the 
      tryptophan (Trp) synthase alpha2beta2 multienzyme complex. We have measured the 
      conformational equilibria of l-Ser and l-Trp complexes, using absorption and 
      fluorescence spectrophotometry with hydrostatic pressure equilibrium perturbation. 
      The effects of monovalent cations, disodium alpha-glycerophosphate (Na2GP), 
      indoleacetylglycine (IAG), and benzimidazole (BZI), as well as of betaE109D and 
      betaD305A mutations, on K(eq) for the conformational equilibria were determined. The 
      l-Ser external aldimine-aminoacrylate equilibrium (K(eq)=[external 
      aldimine]/[aminoacrylate]) has the largest value with Na+ (0.12), followed by K+ 
      (0.04), Li+ (7.6 x 10(-4)), Rb+ (4.3 x 10(-4)), NH4+ (2.3 x 10(-4)), no cation (2.0 
      x 10(-4)) and Cs+ (1.6x10(-5)). alpha-Site ligands, Na(2)GP and IAG, have modest 3- 
      to 40-fold effects on K(eq) in the direction of aminoacrylate, but BZI in the 
      presence of Na+ gives a low value of K(eq) comparable to that obtained with Cs(+). 
      There is no additivity of free energy for Na2GP and BZI, suggesting a common pathway 
      for allosteric communications for both ligands. The values of DeltaV(o) range from 
      -126 mL/mol for the Na+ complex to -204 mL/mol for the Na+ complex with BZI. The 
      betaD305A mutation changes the K(eq) by a factor of at least 10(5) (26.7kJ/mol) and 
      nearly abolishes allosteric communications. There are also dramatic decreases in the 
      magnitude of both DeltaV(o) and DeltaS for the l-Ser external aldimine-aminoacrylate 
      equilibrium for betaD305A Trp synthase, consistent with a large decrease in 
      solvation accompanying the conformational change in betaD305A Trp synthase relative 
      to wild-type Trp synthase. The betaE109D mutation has more modest but significant 
      effects on K(eq), which differ with the ligand, ranging from 40-fold for GP to 
      2200-fold for BZI, even though betaGlu-109 is not directly involved in allosteric 
      communications. The effect of GP on the external aldimine-quinonoid intermediate 
      equilibrium of the Trp synthase-l-Trp complex is similar to that of GP on the Trp 
      synthase-l-Ser external aldimine-aminoacrylate equilibrium. These results have 
      allowed a quantitative comparison of the allosteric effects of ligand and mutations 
      in Trp synthase. These allosteric effects are finely tuned to control the synthesis 
      of l-Trp without resulting in substrate or product inhibition.

AB  - Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) are essential for the biosynthesis and 
      mechanism of action of all steroid hormones. We report the complete kinetic 
      mechanism of a mammalian HSD using rat 3alpha-HSD of the aldo-keto reductase 
      superfamily (AKR1C9) with the substrate pairs androstane-3,17-dione and NADPH 
      (reduction) and androsterone and NADP(+) (oxidation). Steady-state, transient state 
      kinetics, and kinetic isotope effects reconciled the ordered bi-bi mechanism, which 
      contained 9 enzyme forms and permitted the estimation of 16 kinetic constants. In 
      both reactions, loose association of the NADP(H) was followed by two conformational 
      changes, which increased cofactor affinity by >86-fold. For androstane-3,17-dione 
      reduction, the release of NADP(+) controlled k(cat), whereas the chemical event also 
      contributed to this term. k(cat) was insensitive to [(2)H]NADPH, whereas 
      (D)k(cat)/K(m) and the (D)k(lim) (ratio of the maximum rates of single turnover) 
      were 1.06 and 2.06, respectively. Under multiple turnover conditions partial burst 
      kinetics were observed. For androsterone oxidation, the rate of NADPH release 
      dominated k(cat), whereas the rates of the chemical event and the release of 
      androstane-3,17-dione were 50-fold greater. Under multiple turnover conditions full 
      burst kinetics were observed. Although the internal equilibrium constant favored 
      oxidation, the overall K(eq) favored reduction. The kinetic Haldane and free energy 
      diagram confirmed that K(eq) was governed by ligand binding terms that favored the 
      reduction reactants. Thus, HSDs in the aldo-keto reductase superfamily 
      thermodynamically favor ketosteroid reduction.

TI  - Human wild-type alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase and its naturally occurring G82E 
      variant: functional properties and physiological implications.
PG  - 39-50
AB  - Human hepatic peroxisomal AGT (alanine:glyoxylate aminotransferase) is a PLP 
      (pyridoxal 5'-phosphate)-dependent enzyme whose deficiency causes primary 
      hyperoxaluria Type I, a rare autosomal recessive disorder. To acquire experimental 
      evidence for the physiological function of AGT, the K(eq),(overall) of the reaction, 
      the steady-state kinetic parameters of the forward and reverse reactions, and the 
      pre-steady-state kinetics of the half-reactions of the PLP form of AGT with 
      L-alanine or glycine and the PMP (pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate) form with pyruvate or 
      glyoxylate have been measured. The results indicate that the enzyme is highly 
      specific for catalysing glyoxylate to glycine processing, thereby playing a key role 
      in glyoxylate detoxification. Analysis of the reaction course also reveals that PMP 
      remains bound to the enzyme during the catalytic cycle and that the AGT-PMP complex 
      displays a reactivity towards oxo acids higher than that of apoAGT in the presence 
      of PMP. These findings are tentatively related to possible subtle rearrangements at 
      the active site also indicated by the putative binding mode of catalytic 
      intermediates. Additionally, the catalytic and spectroscopic features of the 
      naturally occurring G82E variant have been analysed. Although, like the wild-type, 
      the G82E variant is able to bind 2 mol PLP/dimer, it exhibits a significant reduced 
      affinity for PLP and even more for PMP compared with wild-type, and an altered 
      conformational state of the bound PLP. The striking molecular defect of the mutant, 
      consisting in the dramatic decrease of the overall catalytic activity (approximately 
      0.1% of that of normal AGT), appears to be related to the inability to undergo an 
      efficient transaldimination of the PLP form of the enzyme with amino acids as well 
      as an efficient conversion of AGT-PMP into AGT-PLP. Overall, careful biochemical 
      analyses have allowed elucidation of the mechanism of action of AGT and the way in 
      which the disease causing G82E mutation affects it.

TI  - The relationship of the redox potentials of thioredoxin and thioredoxin reductase 
      from Drosophila melanogaster to the enzymatic mechanism: reduced thioredoxin is the 
      reductant of glutathione in Drosophila.
PG  - 7875-85
AB  - Thioredoxin reductase from Drosophila melanogaster (DmTrxR) catalyzes the reversible 
      transfer of reducing equivalents between NADPH and thioredoxin (Trx), a small 
      protein that is involved in a wide variety of biological redox processes. The 
      catalysis involves three essential redox states of the enzyme: the oxidized form of 
      DmTrxR (Eox), the 2-electron-reduced forms (EH2), and the 4-electron-reduced forms 
      (EH4). In the present work, the macroscopic redox potentials of Eox/EH2 and EH2/EH4 
      couples were determined to be -272 +/- 5 mV for Em(Eox/EH2) and -298 +/- 11 mV for 
      Em(EH2/EH4) on the basis of redox equilibria between DmTrxR and NADH. The value for 
      Em(EH2/EH4) obtained from the steady-state kinetics of the TrxR-catalyzed reaction 
      between NADPH and D. melanogaster Trx-2 (DmTrx-2) was reasonably consistent with 
      that based on redox equilibria. The redox potential of the Trx-(S)2/Trx-(SH)2 couple 
      from D. melanogaster Trx-2 (DmTrx-2) was calculated to be -275.4 +/- 0.3 mV by using 
      the Nernst equation and the Keq for the equilibrium of the reaction involving 
      NADP/NADPH and Trx-(S)2/Trx-(SH)2. For the accurate determination of the Keq, an 
      improved protocol has been developed to minimize errors that can be introduced by 
      using starting concentrations far from equilibrium of the TrxR-catalyzed reaction 
      between NADPH and Trx. This improved approach gives an Em of -284.2 +/- 1.0 mV for 
      Escherichia coli Trx and -271.9 +/- 0.4 mV for Plasmodium falciparum Trx, which 
      agree well with published values (-283 or -285 mV and -270 mV, respectively). The 
      redox potentials determined herein provide further direct evidence for the proposed 
      catalytic mechanism of DmTrxR, and cast new light on the essential role of the DmTrx 
      system in cycling GSSG/GSH and maintaining the intracellular redox homeostasis in D. 
      melanogaster where glutathione reductase is absent.

TI  - 2-Hydroxychromene-2-carboxylic acid isomerase: a kappa class glutathione transferase 
      from Pseudomonas putida.
PG  - 6710-22
AB  - The enzyme 2-hydroxychromene-2-carboxylic acid (HCCA) isomerase catalyzes the 
      glutathione (GSH)-dependent interconversion (Keq = 1.5) of HCCA and 
      trans-o-hydroxybenzylidene pyruvic acid (tHBPA) in the naphthalene catabolic pathway 
      of Pseudomonas putida. The dimeric protein binds one molecule of GSH very tightly 
      (Kd approximately 5 nM) and a second molecule of GSH with much lower affinity (Kd 
      approximately 2 to 11 microM). The enzyme is unstable in the absence of GSH. The 
      turnover number in the forward direction (47 s(-1) at 25 degrees C) greatly exceeds 
      off rates for GSH (koff approximately 10(-3) to 10(-2) s(-1) at 10 degrees C), 
      suggesting that GSH acts as a tightly bound cofactor in the reaction. The crystal 
      structure of the enzyme at 1.7 A resolution reveals that the isomerase is closely 
      related to class kappa GSH transferases. Diffraction quality crystals could only be 
      obtained in the presence of GSH and HCCA/tHBPA. Clear electron density is seen for 
      GSH. Electron density for the organic substrates is located near the GSH and is best 
      modeled to include both HCCA and tHBPA at occupancies of 0.5 for each. Although 
      there is no electron density connecting the sulfur of GSH to the organic substrates, 
      the sulfur is located very close (2.78 A) to C7 of HCCA. Taken together, the results 
      suggest that the isomerization reaction involves a short-lived covalent adduct 
      between the sulfur of GSH and C7 of the substrate.

TI  - Nature of hydrogen interactions with Ni(II) complexes containing cyclic phosphine 
      ligands with pendant nitrogen bases.
PG  - 6951-6
AB  - Studies of the role of proton relays in molecular catalysts for the electrocatalytic 
      production and oxidation of H(2) have been carried out. The electrochemical 
      production of hydrogen from protonated DMF solutions catalyzed by 
      [Ni(P(2)(Ph)N(2)(Ph))(2)(CH(3)CN)](BF(4))(2), 3a (where P(2)(Ph)N(2)(Ph) is 
      1,3,5,7-tetraphenyl-1,5-diaza-3,7-diphosphacyclooctane), permits a limiting value of 
      the H(2) production rate to be determined. The turnover frequency of 350 s(-1) 
      establishes that the rate of H(2) production for the mononuclear nickel catalyst 3a 
      is comparable to those observed for Ni-Fe hydrogenase enzymes. In the 
      electrochemical oxidation of hydrogen catalyzed by 
      [Ni(P(2)(Cy)N(2)(Bz))(2)](BF(4))(2), 3b (where Cy is cyclohexyl and Bz is benzyl), 
      the initial step is the reversible addition of hydrogen to 3b (K(eq) = 190 atm(-1) 
      at 25 degrees C). The hydrogen addition product exists as three nearly isoenergetic 
      isomers 4A-4C, which have been identified by a combination of one- and 
      two-dimensional (1)H, (31)P, and (15)N NMR spectroscopies as Ni(0) complexes with a 
      protonated amine in each cyclic ligand. The nature of the isomers, together with 
      calculations, suggests a mode of hydrogen activation that involves a symmetrical 
      interaction of a nickel dihydrogen ligand with two amine bases in the diphosphine 
      ligands. Single deprotonation of 4 by an external base results in a rearrangement to 
      [HNi(P(2)(Cy)N(2)(Bz))(2)](BF(4)), 5, and this reaction is reversed by the addition 
      of a proton to the nickel hydride complex. The small energy differences associated 
      with significantly different distributions in electron density and protons within 
      these molecules may contribute to their high catalytic activity.

TI  - Basis for the equilibrium constant in the interconversion of l-lysine and 
      l-beta-lysine by lysine 2,3-aminomutase.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - l-beta-lysine and beta-glutamate are produced by the actions of lysine 
      2,3-aminomutase and glutamate 2,3-aminomutase, respectively. The pK(a) values have 
      been titrimetrically measured and are for l-beta-lysine: pK(1)=3.25 (carboxyl), 
      pK(2)=9.30 (beta-aminium), and pK(3)=10.5 (epsilon-aminium). For beta-glutamate the 
      values are pK(1)=3.13 (carboxyl), pK(2)=3.73 (carboxyl), and pK(3)=10.1 
      (beta-aminium). The equilibrium constants for reactions of 2,3-aminomutases favor 
      the beta-isomers. The pH and temperature dependencies of K(eq) have been measured 
      for the reaction of lysine 2,3-aminomutase to determine the basis for preferential 
      formation of beta-lysine. The value of K(eq) (8.5 at 37 degrees C) is independent of 
      pH between pH 6 and pH 11; ruling out differences in pK-values as the basis for the 
      equilibrium constant. The K(eq)-value is temperature-dependent and ranges from 10.9 
      at 4 degrees C to 6.8 at 65 degrees C. The linear van't Hoff plot shows the reaction 
      to be enthalpy-driven, with DeltaH degrees =-1.4 kcal mol(-1) and DeltaS degrees 
      =-0.25 cal deg(-1) mol(-1). Exothermicity is attributed to the greater strength of 
      the bond C(beta)-N(beta) in l-beta-lysine than C(alpha)-N(alpha) in l-lysine, and 
      this should hold for other amino acids.

TI  - Complete kinetic mechanism of homoisocitrate dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae.
PG  - 890-8
AB  - The kinetic mechanism of homoisocitrate dehydrogenase from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 
      was determined using initial velocity studies in the absence and presence of product 
      and dead end inhibitors in both reaction directions. Data suggest a steady state 
      random kinetic mechanism. The dissociation constant of the Mg-homoisocitrate complex 
      (MgHIc) was estimated to be 11 +/- 2 mM as measured using Mg2+ as a shift reagent. 
      Initial velocity data indicate the MgHIc complex is the reactant in the direction of 
      oxidative decarboxylation, while in the reverse reaction direction, the enzyme 
      likely binds uncomplexed Mg2+ and alpha-ketoadipate. Curvature is observed in the 
      double-reciprocal plots for product inhibition by NADH and the dead-end inhibition 
      by 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide phosphate when MgHIc is the varied 
      substrate. At low concentrations of MgHIc, the inhibition by both nucleotides is 
      competitive, but as the MgHIc concentration increases, the inhibition changes to 
      uncompetitive, consistent with a steady state random mechanism with preferred 
      binding of MgHIc before NAD. Release of product is preferred and ordered with 
      respect to CO2, alpha-ketoadipate, and NADH. Isocitrate is a slow substrate with a 
      rate (V/E(t)) 216-fold slower than that measured with HIc. In contrast to HIc, the 
      uncomplexed form of isocitrate and Mg2+ bind to the enzyme. The kinetic mechanism in 
      the direction of oxidative decarboxylation of isocitrate, on the basis of initial 
      velocity studies in the absence and presence of dead-end inhibitors, suggests random 
      addition of NAD and isocitrate with Mg2+ binding before isocitrate in rapid 
      equilibrium, and the mechanism approximates rapid equilibrium random. The Keq for 
      the overall reaction measured directly using the change in NADH as a probe is 0.45 
      M.

TI  - Arabidopsis isochorismate synthase functional in pathogen-induced salicylate 
      biosynthesis exhibits properties consistent with a role in diverse stress responses.
PG  - 5919-33
AB  - Salicylic acid (SA) is a phytohormone best known for its role in plant defense. It 
      is synthesized in response to diverse pathogens and responsible for the large scale 
      transcriptional induction of defense-related genes and the establishment of systemic 
      acquired resistance. Surprisingly, given its importance in plant defense, an 
      understanding of the underlying enzymology is lacking. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the 
      pathogen-induced accumulation of SA requires isochorismate synthase (AtICS1). Here, 
      we show that AtICS1 is a plastid-localized, stromal protein using chloroplast import 
      assays and immunolocalization. AtICS1 acts as a monofunctional isochorismate 
      synthase (ICS), catalyzing the conversion of chorismate to isochorismate (IC) in a 
      reaction that operates near equilibrium (K(eq) = 0.89). It does not convert 
      chorismate directly to SA (via an IC intermediate) as does Yersinia enterocolitica 
      Irp9. Using an irreversible coupled spectrophotometric assay, we found that AtICS1 
      exhibits an apparent K(m) of 41.5 mum and k(cat) = 38.7 min(-1) for chorismate. This 
      affinity for chorismate would allow it to successfully compete with other 
      pathogen-induced, chorismate-utilizing enzymes. Furthermore, the biochemical 
      properties of AtICS1 indicate its activity is not regulated by light-dependent 
      changes in stromal pH, Mg(2+), or redox and that it is remarkably active at 4 
      degrees C consistent with a role for SA in cold-tolerant growth. Finally, our 
      analyses support plastidic synthesis of stress-induced SA with the requirement for 
      one or more additional enzymes responsible for the conversion of IC to SA, because 
      non-enzymatic conversion of IC to SA under physiological conditions was negligible.
