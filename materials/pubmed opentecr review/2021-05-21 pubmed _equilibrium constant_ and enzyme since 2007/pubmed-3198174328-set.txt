TI  - Kinetic and oligomeric study of Leishmania braziliensis nicotinate/nicotinamide

AB  - Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is an essential coenzyme involved in REDOX 
      reactions and oxidative stress defense systems. Furthermore, NAD is used as 
      substrate by proteins that regulate essential cellular functions as DNA repair, 
      genetic, and signal transduction, among many others. NAD biosynthesis can be 
      completed through the de novo and salvage pathways, which converge at the common 
      step catalyzed by the nicotinate/nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 
      (NMNAT EC: 2.7.7.1/18). Here, we report the kinetic characterization of the NMNAT of 
      Leishmania braziliensis (LbNMNAT), one of the etiological agents of leishmaniasis, a 
      relevant parasitic disease. The expression and homogeneous purification of the 
      recombinant 6xHis-LbNMNAT protein was carried out and its kinetic study, which 
      included analysis of K (m) , V (max) , K (cat) and the equilibrium constant (K (D) ) 
      for both the forward and reverse reactions, was completed. The oligomeric state of 
      the recombinant 6xHis-LbNMNAT protein was studied through size exclusion 
      chromatography. Our results indicated the highest and lowest K (m) values for ATP 
      and NAD, respectively. According to the calculated K (D) , the pyrophosphorolytic 
      cleavage of NAD is favored in vitro. Moreover, the recombinant 6xHis-LbNMNAT protein 
      showed a monomeric state, although it exhibits a structural element involved in 
      potential subunits interaction. Altogether, our results denote notable differences 
      of the LbNMNAT protein in relation to the human orthologs HsNMNAT1-3. These 
      differences constitute initial findings that have to be continued to finally propose 
      the NMNAT as a promissory pharmacological target in L. braziliensis.

AB  - The glycolytic pathway is present in most organisms and represents a central part of 
      the energy production mechanism in a cell. For a general understanding of 
      glycolysis, the investigation from a thermodynamic point of view is essential and 
      allows realising thermodynamic feasibility analyses under in vivo conditions. 
      However, available literature standard Gibbs energies of reaction, Δ(R)g'(0), are 
      calculated using equilibrium-molality ratios K(m)', which might lead to a 
      misinterpretation of the glycolytic pathway. It was the aim of this work to 
      thermodynamically investigate the triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) reaction to 
      provide new activity-based reaction data. In vitro equilibrium experiments were 
      performed, and activity coefficients were predicted with the equation of state 
      electrolyte PC-SAFT (ePC-SAFT). The combination of experimental concentrations and 
      predicted activity coefficients yielded the thermodynamic equilibrium constant K(a) 
      and a new value for Δ(R)g'(0)(298.15 K, pH 7) = 7.1 ± 0.3 kJ mol(‑1). The 
      availability of the new Δ(R)g'(0) value allowed predicting influences of the 
      reaction medium on the reaction equilibrium of the TPI reaction. In this work, 
      influences of the initial substrate concentration, pH and Mg(2+) concentration on 
      the reaction equilibrium were investigated and a method is presented to predict 
      these influences. The higher the substrate concentration and the higher the 
      temperature, the stronger the reaction equilibrium is shifted on the product side. 
      While the pH did not have a significant influence on the reaction equilibrium, 
      Mg(2+) yielded a shift of the reaction equilibrium to the substrate side. All these 
      effects were predicted correctly with ePC-SAFT. Based on the ePC-SAFT predictions we 
      concluded that a charge-reduction of the product by complexation of the product with 
      Mg(2+) was responsible for the strong influence of Mg(2+) on the reaction 
      equilibrium. Finally, the standard enthalpy of reaction of 
      Δ(R)h('0)(pH 7) = 18 ± 7 kJ mol(‑1) was determined with the equilibrium constants 
      K(a) at 298.15 K, 304.15 K and 310.15 K using the van 't Hoff equation.

LID - e0217713
AB  - N-acetylneuraminate lyases (NALs) are enzymes that catalyze the reversible cleavage 
      and synthesis of sialic acids. They are therefore commonly used for the production 
      of these high-value sugars. This study presents the recombinant production, together 
      with biochemical and structural data, of the NAL from the psychrophilic bacterium 
      Aliivibrio salmonicida LFI1238 (AsNAL). Our characterization shows that AsNAL 
      possesses high activity and stability at alkaline pH. We confirm that these 
      properties allow for the use in a one-pot reaction at alkaline pH for the synthesis 
      of N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac, the most common sialic acid) from the 
      inexpensive precursor N-acetylglucosamine. We also show that the enzyme has a cold 
      active nature with an optimum temperature for Neu5Ac synthesis at 20°C. The 
      equilibrium constant for the reaction was calculated at different temperatures, and 
      the formation of Neu5Ac acid is favored at low temperatures, making the cold active 
      enzyme a well-suited candidate for use in such exothermic reactions. The specific 
      activity is high compared to the homologue from Escherichia coli at three tested 
      temperatures, and the enzyme shows a higher catalytic efficiency and turnover number 
      for cleavage at 37°C. Mutational studies reveal that amino acid residue Asn 168 is 
      important for the high kcat. The crystal structure of AsNAL was solved to 1.65 Å 
      resolution and reveals a compact, tetrameric protein similar to other NAL 
      structures. The data presented provides a framework to guide further optimization of 
      its application in sialic acid production and opens the possibility for further 
      design of the enzyme.

LID - 10.1002/chir.23070 [doi]
AB  - The enantioselective esterification of ibuprofen catalyzed by Novozym40086 was 
      successfully conducted in organic solvent. Removing-water reagent was added into the 
      reaction mixture to remove water produced in the esterification. The effects of 
      temperature, n-hexanol concentration, ibuprofen concentration, and loading of 
      enzymes were investigated. Under the condition of equilibrium, the thermodynamic 
      equilibrium constant (K) of 7.697 and enantioselectivity (E) of 8.512 were obtained. 
      The esterification reaction achieved its equilibrium in approximately 30 hours with 
      conversion of 56% and ee(S) of 93.78%. The predicted values of X and ee(S) were 
      67.90% and 95.60%, respectively. The experimental value is approximately equal to 
      the theoretical value, which indicates the feasibility of ideal models.

TI  - Insights into Urease Inhibition by N-( n-Butyl) Phosphoric Triamide through an 
      Integrated Structural and Kinetic Approach.
PG  - 2127-2138
LID - 10.1021/acs.jafc.8b04791 [doi]
AB  - The nickel-dependent enzyme urease represents a negative element for the efficiency 
      of soil nitrogen fertilization as well as a virulence factor for a large number of 
      pathogenic and antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The development of ever more efficient 
      urease inhibitors demands knowledge of their modes of action at the molecular level. 
      N-( n-Butyl)-phosphoric triamide (NBPTO) is the oxo-derivative of N-( 
      n-butyl)-thiophosphoric triamide (NBPT), which is extensively employed in 
      agriculture to increase the efficiency of urea-based fertilizers. The 1.45 Å 
      resolution structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex obtained upon incubation of 
      Sporosarcina pasteurii urease (SPU) with NBPTO shows the presence of diamido 
      phosphoric acid (DAP), generated upon enzymatic hydrolysis of NBPTO with the release 
      of n-butyl amine. DAP is bound in a tridentate binding mode to the two Ni(II) ions 
      in the active site of urease via two O atoms and an amide NH(2) group, whereas the 
      second amide group of DAP points away from the metal center into the active-site 
      channel. The mobile flap modulating the size of the active-site cavity is found in a 
      disordered closed-open conformation. A kinetic characterization of the NBPTO-based 
      inhibition of both bacterial (SPU) and plant ( Canavalia ensiformis or jack bean, 
      JBU) ureases, carried out by calorimetric measurements, indicates the occurrence of 
      a reversible slow-inhibition mode of action. The latter is characterized by a very 
      small value of the equilibrium dissociation constant of the urease-DAP complex 
      caused, in turn, by the large rate constant for the formation of the 
      enzyme-inhibitor complex. The much greater capability of NBPTO to inhibit urease, as 
      compared with that of NBPT, is thus not caused by the presence of a P═O moiety 
      versus a P═S moiety, as previously suggested, but rather by the readiness of NBPTO 
      to react with urease without the need to convert one of the P-NH(2) amide moieties 
      to its P-OH acid derivative, as in the case of NBPT. The latter process is indeed 
      characterized by a very small equilibrium constant that reduces drastically the 
      concentration of the active form of the inhibitor in the case of NBPT. This 
      indicates that high-efficiency phosphoramide-based urease inhibitors must have at 
      least one O atom bound to the central P atom in order for the molecule to 
      efficiently and rapidly bind to the dinickel center of the enzyme.

      Formation of the Activated Conformation of the Enzyme.

AB  - Liver phenylalanine hydroxylase (PheH) is an allosteric enzyme that is activated by 
      phenylalanine. The enzyme is also phosphorylated by protein kinase A, but the 
      effects of phosphorylation are unclear. Recent structural studies ( Meisburger et 
      al. ( 2016 ) J. Amer. Chem. Soc. 138 , 6506 - 6516 ) support a model in which 
      activation of the enzyme involves dimerization of the regulatory domains, creating 
      the allosteric site for phenylalanine at the dimer interface. This conformational 
      change also results in a change in the fluorescence of the protein that can be used 
      to monitor activation. The kinetics of activation of PheH are biphasic over a range 
      of phenylalanine concentrations. These data are well-described by a model involving 
      an initial equilibrium between the resting form and the activated conformation, with 
      a value of the equilibrium constant for formation of the activated conformation, L, 
      equal to 0.007, followed by binding of two molecules of phenylalanine. 
      Phosphorylation increases L 10-fold by increasing the rate constant for conversion 
      of the resting form to the activated form. The results provide functional support 
      for the previous structural model, identify the specific effect of phosphorylation 
      on the enzyme, and rationalize the lack of change in the protein structure upon 
      phosphorylation.

TI  - Sulfonium Ion Condensation: The Burden Borne by SAM Synthetase.
PG  - 3549-3551
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.8b00477 [doi]
AB  - S-Adenosylmethionine (SAM(+)) serves as the principal methylating agent in 
      biological systems, but the thermodynamic basis of its reactivity does not seem to 
      have been clearly established. Here, we show that methionine, methanol, and H(+) 
      combine to form S-methylmethionine (SMM(+)) with a temperature-independent 
      equilibrium constant of 9.9 M(-2). The corresponding group transfer potential of 
      SMM(+) (its free energy of hydrolysis at pH 7) is -8.2 kcal/mol. The "energy-rich" 
      nature of sulfonium ions is related to the extreme acidity (p K(a) -5.4) of the 
      S-protonated thioether produced by sulfonium hydrolysis, and the large negative free 
      energy of deprotonation of that species in neutral solution (-16.7 kcal/mol). At pH 
      7, SAM synthetase requires the free energy released by cleavage of two bonds of ATP 
      to reverse that process.

TI  - Co-solvent effects on reaction rate and reaction equilibrium of an enzymatic peptide 
      hydrolysis.
PG  - 11317-11326
LID - 10.1039/c7cp07346a [doi]
AB  - This work presents an approach that expresses the Michaelis constant KaM and the 
      equilibrium constant Kth of an enzymatic peptide hydrolysis based on thermodynamic 
      activities instead of concentrations. This provides KaM and Kth values that are 
      independent of any co-solvent. To this end, the hydrolysis reaction of 
      N-succinyl-l-phenylalanine-p-nitroanilide catalysed by the enzyme α-chymotrypsin was 
      studied in pure buffer and in the presence of the co-solvents dimethyl sulfoxide, 
      trimethylamine-N-oxide, urea, and two salts. A strong influence of the co-solvents 
      on the measured Michaelis constant (KM) and equilibrium constant (Kx) was observed, 
      which was found to be caused by molecular interactions expressed as activity 
      coefficients. Substrate and product activity coefficients were used to calculate the 
      activity-based values KaM and Kth for the co-solvent free reaction. Based on these 
      constants, the co-solvent effect on KM and Kx was predicted in almost quantitative 
      agreement with the experimental data. The approach presented here does not only 
      reveal the importance of understanding the thermodynamic non-ideality of reactions 
      taking place in biological solutions and in many technological applications, it also 
      provides a framework for interpreting and quantifying the multifaceted co-solvent 
      effects on enzyme-catalysed reactions that are known and have been observed 
      experimentally for a long time.

AB  - Understanding how to perform an enzyme assay is a critical learning skill in the 
      undergraduate biochemistry curriculum. Students in biochemistry typically have been 
      exposed to the use of NMR spectroscopy as a tool to determine chemical structure, 
      but rarely are they exposed to the utility of NMR to evaluate enzyme kinetics. 
      Furthermore, coverage of NMR experiments utilizing "alternative nuclei", such as 
      (15) N, (19) F, and (31) P may be neglected. Herein we report a simple (31) P NMR 
      tube experiment that allows students to examine the enzyme kinetics and equilibrium 
      constant of the reaction catalyzed by pyruvate kinase. © 2017 by The International

TI  - Structural Insights into the TLA-3 Extended-Spectrum β-Lactamase and Its Inhibition 
      by Avibactam and OP0595.
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00501-17 [doi]
LID - e00501-17
AB  - The development of effective inhibitors that block extended-spectrum β-lactamases 
      (ESBLs) and restore the action of β-lactams represents an effective strategy against 
      ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae We evaluated the inhibitory effects of the 
      diazabicyclooctanes avibactam and OP0595 against TLA-3, an ESBL that we identified 
      previously. Avibactam and OP0595 inhibited TLA-3 with apparent inhibitor constants 
      (K(i)(app)) of 1.71 ± 0.10 and 1.49 ± 0.05 μM, respectively, and could restore 
      susceptibility to cephalosporins in the TLA-3-producing Escherichia coli strain. The 
      value of the second-order acylation rate constant (k(2)/K, where k(2) is the 
      acylation rate constant and K is the equilibrium constant) of avibactam [(3.25 ± 
      0.03) × 10(3) M(-1) · s(-1)] was closer to that of class C and D β-lactamases 
      (k(2)/K, <10(4) M(-1) · s(-1)) than that of class A β-lactamases (k(2)/K, >10(4) 
      M(-1) · s(-1)). In addition, we determined the structure of TLA-3 and that of TLA-3 
      complexed with avibactam or OP0595 at resolutions of 1.6, 1.6, and 2.0 Å, 
      respectively. TLA-3 contains an inverted Ω loop and an extended loop between the β5 
      and β6 strands (insertion after Ser237), which appear only in PER-type class A 
      β-lactamases. These structures might favor the accommodation of cephalosporins 
      harboring bulky R1 side chains. TLA-3 presented a high catalytic efficiency 
      (k(cat)/K(m) ) against cephalosporins, including cephalothin, cefuroxime, and 
      cefotaxime. Avibactam and OP0595 bound covalently to TLA-3 via the Ser70 residue and 
      made contacts with residues Ser130, Thr235, and Ser237, which are conserved in 
      ESBLs. Additionally, the sulfate group of the inhibitors formed polar contacts with 
      amino acid residues in a positively charged pocket of TLA-3. Our findings provide a 
      structural template for designing improved diazabicyclooctane-based inhibitors that 
      are effective against ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

AB  - Succinic acid (SA) was esterified with ethanol using Candida antarctica lipase B 
      immobilized on acrylic resin at 40 and 50 °C. Enzyme activity in the reaction medium 
      was assured prior to reaction experiments. Reaction-equilibrium experiments were 
      performed for varying initial molalities of SA and water in the reaction mixtures. 
      This allowed calculating the molality-based apparent equilibrium constant K (m) as 
      function of concentration and temperature. K (m) was shown to depend strongly on the 
      molality of water and SA as well as on temperature. It could be concluded that 
      increasing the molality of SA shifted the reaction equilibrium towards the products. 
      Water had a strong effect on the activity of the enzyme and on K (m) . The 
      concentration dependence of K (m) values was explained by the activity coefficients 
      of the reacting agents. These were predicted with the thermodynamic models 
      Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT), NRTL, and Universal 
      Quasichemical Functional Group Activity Coefficients (UNIFAC), yielding the ratio of 
      activity coefficients of products and reactants K (γ) . All model parameters were 
      taken from literature. The models yielded K (γ) values between 25 and 115. Thus, 
      activity coefficients have a huge impact on the consistent determination of the 
      thermodynamic equilibrium constants K (th). Combining K (m) and PC-SAFT-predicted K 
      (γ) allowed determining K (th) and the standard Gibbs energy of reaction as function 
      of temperature. This value was shown to be in very good agreement with results 
      obtained from group contribution methods for Gibbs energy of formation. In contrast, 
      inconsistencies were observed for K (th) using K (γ) values from the classical 
      g(E)-models UNIFAC and NRTL. The importance of activity coefficients opens the door 
      for an optimized reaction setup for enzymatic esterifications.

TI  - Expanding the substrate scope of phenylalanine ammonia-lyase from Petroselinum 
      crispum towards styrylalanines.
PG  - 3717-3727
LID - 10.1039/c7ob00562h [doi]
AB  - This study focuses on the expansion of the substrate scope of phenylalanine 
      ammonia-lyase from Petroselinum crispum (PcPAL) towards the l-enantiomers of racemic 
      styrylalanines rac-1a-d - which are less studied and synthetically challenging 
      unnatural amino acids - by reshaping the aromatic binding pocket of the active site 
      of PcPAL by point mutations. Ammonia elimination from l-styrylalanine (l-1a) 
      catalyzed by non-mutated PcPAL (wt-PcPAL) took place with a 777-fold lower 
      k(cat)/K(M) value than the deamination of the natural substrate, l-Phe. Computer 
      modeling of the reactions catalyzed by wt-PcPAL indicated an unproductive and two 
      major catalytically active conformations and detrimental interactions between the 
      aromatic moiety of l-styrylalanine, l-1a, and the phenyl ring of the residue F137 in 
      the aromatic binding region of the active site. Replacing the residue F137 by 
      smaller hydrophobic residues resulted in a small mutant library (F137X-PcPAL, X 
      being V, A, and G), from which F137V-PcPAL could transform l-styrylalanine with 
      comparable activity to that of the wt-PcPAL with l-Phe. Furthermore, F137V-PcPAL 
      showed superior catalytic efficiency in the ammonia elimination reaction of several 
      racemic styrylalanine derivatives (rac-1a-d) providing access to d-1a-d by kinetic 
      resolution, even though the d-enantiomers proved to be reversible inhibitors. The 
      enhanced catalytic efficiency of F137V-PcPAL towards racemic styrylalanines rac-1a-d 
      could be rationalized by molecular modeling, indicating the more relaxed 
      enzyme-substrate complexes and the promotion of conformations with higher catalytic 
      activities as the main reasons. Unfortunately, ammonia addition onto the 
      corresponding styrylacrylates 2a-d failed with both wt-PcPAL and F137V-PcPAL. The 
      low equilibrium constant of the ammonia addition, the poor ligand binding affinities 
      of 2a-d, and the non-productive binding states of the unsaturated ligands 2a-d 
      within the active sites of either wt-PcPAL or F137V-PcPAL - as indicated by 
      molecular modeling - might be responsible for the inactivity of the PcPAL variants 
      in the reverse reaction. Modeling predicted that the F137V mutation is beneficial 
      for the KRs of 4-fluoro-, 4-cyano- and 4-bromostyrylalanines, but non-effective for 
      the KR process of 4-trifluoromethylstyrylalanine.

TI  - The promiscuous enzyme medium-chain 3-keto-acyl-CoA thiolase triggers a vicious 
      cycle in fatty-acid beta-oxidation.
PG  - e1005461

LID - e1005461
AB  - Mitochondrial fatty-acid beta-oxidation (mFAO) plays a central role in mammalian 
      energy metabolism. Multiple severe diseases are associated with defects in this 
      pathway. Its kinetic structure is characterized by a complex wiring of which the 
      functional implications have hardly been explored. Repetitive cycles of reversible 
      reactions, each cycle shortening the fatty acid by two carbon atoms, evoke 
      competition between intermediates of different chain lengths for a common set of 
      'promiscuous' enzymes (enzymes with activity towards multiple substrates). In our 
      validated kinetic model of the pathway, substrate overload causes a steep and 
      detrimental flux decline. Here, we unravel the underlying mechanism and the role of 
      enzyme promiscuity in it. Comparison of alternative model versions elucidated the 
      role of promiscuity of individual enzymes. Promiscuity of the last enzyme of the 
      pathway, medium-chain ketoacyl-CoA thiolase (MCKAT), was both necessary and 
      sufficient to elicit the flux decline. Subsequently, Metabolic Control Analysis 
      revealed that MCKAT had insufficient capacity to cope with high substrate influx. 
      Next, we quantified the internal metabolic regulation, revealing a vicious cycle 
      around MCKAT. Upon substrate overload, MCKAT's ketoacyl-CoA substrates started to 
      accumulate. The unfavourable equilibrium constant of the preceding enzyme, 
      medium/short-chain hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, worked as an amplifier, leading to 
      accumulation of upstream CoA esters, including acyl-CoA esters. These acyl-CoA 
      esters are at the same time products of MCKAT and inhibited its already low activity 
      further. Finally, the accumulation of CoA esters led to a sequestration of free CoA. 
      CoA being a cofactor for MCKAT, its sequestration limited the MCKAT activity even 
      further, thus completing the vicious cycle. Since CoA is also a substrate for 
      distant enzymes, it efficiently communicated the 'traffic jam' at MCKAT to the 
      entire pathway. This novel mechanism provides a basis to explore the role of mFAO in 
      disease and elucidate similar principles in other pathways of lipid metabolism.

      with Clostridium tyrobutyricum.
PG  - 1428-1437
LID - 10.1002/bit.26289 [doi]
AB  - Butyl butyrate (BB) is a valuable chemical that can be used as flavor, fragrance, 
      extractant, and so on in various industries. Meanwhile, BB can also be used as a 
      fuel source with excellent compatibility as gasoline, aviation kerosene, and diesel 
      components. The conventional industrial production of BB is highly energy-consuming 
      and generates various environmental pollutants. Recently, there have been tremendous 
      interests in producing BB from renewable resources through biological routes. In 
      this study, based on the fermentation using the hyper-butyrate producing strain 
      Clostridium tyrobutyricum ATCC 25755, efficient BB production through in situ 
      esterification was achieved by supplementation of lipase and butanol into the 
      fermentation. Three commercially available lipases were assessed and the one from 
      Candida sp. (recombinant, expressed in Aspergillus niger) was identified with 
      highest catalytic activity for BB production. Various conditions that might affect 
      BB production in the fermentation have been further evaluated, including the 
      extractant type, enzyme loading, agitation, pH, and butanol supplementation 
      strategy. Under the optimized conditions (5.0 g L(-1) of enzyme loading, pH at 5.5, 
      butanol kept at 10.0 g L(-1) ), 34.7 g L(-1) BB was obtained with complete 
      consumption of 50 g L(-1) glucose as the starting substrate. To our best knowledge, 
      the BB production achieved in this study is the highest among the ever reported from 
      the batch fermentation process. Our results demonstrated an excellent biological 
      platform for renewable BB production from low-value carbon sources. Biotechnol.

TI  - Genetics, Transcriptional Profiles, and Catalytic Properties of the UDP-Arabinose 
      Mutase Family from Barley.
PG  - 322-34
LID - 10.1021/acs.biochem.5b01055 [doi]
AB  - Four members of the UDP-Ara mutase (UAM) gene family from barley have been isolated 
      and characterized, and their map positions on chromosomes 2H, 3H, and 4H have been 
      defined. When the genes are expressed in Escherichia coli, the corresponding HvUAM1, 
      HvUAM2, and HvUAM3 proteins exhibit UAM activity, and the kinetic properties of the 
      enzymes have been determined, including Km, Kcat, and catalytic efficiencies. 
      However, the expressed HvUAM4 protein shows no mutase activity against UDP-Ara or 
      against a broad range of other nucleotide sugars and related molecules. The enzymic 
      data indicate therefore that the HvUAM4 protein may not be a mutase. However, the 
      HvUAM4 gene is transcribed at high levels in all the barley tissues examined, and 
      its transcript abundance is correlated with transcript levels for other genes 
      involved in cell wall biosynthesis. The UDP-l-Arap → UDP-l-Araf reaction, which is 
      essential for the generation of the UDP-Araf substrate for arabinoxylan, 
      arabinogalactan protein, and pectic polysaccharide biosynthesis, is 
      thermodynamically unfavorable and has an equilibrium constant of 0.02. Nevertheless, 
      the incorporation of Araf residues into nascent polysaccharides clearly occurs at 
      biologically appropriate rates. The characterization of the HvUAM genes opens the 
      way for the manipulation of both the amounts and fine structures of heteroxylans in 
      cereals, grasses, and other crop plants, with a view toward enhancing their value in 
      human health and nutrition, and in renewable biofuel production.

AB  - We determined the crystal structure of EcL-DER to elucidate protein function and 
      substrate specificity. Unlike other asp/glu racemases, EcL-DER has an unbalanced 
      pair of catalytic residues, Thr83/Cys197, at the active site that is crucial for L- 
      to D-unidirectional racemase activity. EcL-DER exhibited racemase activity for both 
      L-glutamate and L-aspartate, but had threefold higher activity for L-glutamate. 
      Based on the structure of the EcL-DER(C197S) mutant in complex with L-glutamate, we 
      determined the binding mode of the L-glutamate substrate in EcL-DER and provide a 
      structural basis for how the protein utilizes L-glutamate as a main substrate. The 
      unidirectionality, despite an equilibrium constant of unity, can be understood in 
      terms of the Haldane relationship.

TI  - Stability engineering of the Geobacillus stearothermophilus alcohol dehydrogenase 
      and application for the synthesis of a polyamide 12 precursor.
PG  - 10501-13
LID - 10.1007/s00253-015-6930-5 [doi]
AB  - The thermostable NAD(+)-dependent alcohol dehydrogenase from Geobacillus 
      stearothermophilus (BsADH) was exploited with regard to the biocatalytic synthesis 
      of ω-oxo lauric acid methyl ester (OLAMe), a key intermediate for biobased polyamide 
      12 production, from the corresponding long-chain alcohol. Recombinant BsADH was 
      produced in Escherichia coli as a homogeneous tetrameric enzyme and showed high 
      activity towards the industrially relevant substrate ω-hydroxy lauric acid methyl 
      ester (HLAMe) with K M = 86 μM and 44 U mg(-1). The equilibrium constant for HLAMe 
      oxidation to the aldehyde (OLAMe) with NAD(+) was determined as 2.16 × 10(-3) from 
      the kinetic parameters of the BsADH-catalyzed forward and reverse reactions. Since 
      BsADH displayed limited stability under oxidizing conditions, the predominant 
      oxidation-prone residue Cys257 was mutated to Leu based on sequence homology with 
      related enzymes and computational simulation. This substitution resulted in an 
      improved BsADH variant exhibiting prolonged stability and an elevated inactivation 
      temperature. Semi-preparative biocatalysis at 60 °C using the stabilized enzyme, 
      employing butyraldehyde for in situ cofactor regeneration with only catalytic 
      amounts of NAD(+), yielded up to 23 % conversion of HLAMe to OLAMe after 30 min. In 
      contrast to other oxidoreductases, no overoxidation to the dodecanoic diacid 
      monomethyl ester was detected. Thus, the mutated BsADH offers a promising 
      biocatalyst for the selective oxidation of fatty alcohols to yield intermediates for 
      industrial polymer production.

TI  - Production of fumaric acid from L-malic acid by solvent engineering using a 
      recombinant thermostable fumarase from Thermus thermophilus HB8.
PG  - 2823-31
LID - 10.1007/s12010-014-1468-z [doi]
AB  - Currently, fumaric acid is produced by catalytic isomerization of maleic acid in 
      aqueous solutions at low pH. Being petroleum based, requiring catalyst, and 
      producing vast amounts of by-products and wastewater, the production of fumaric acid 
      from renewable resources by a "green" process is increasingly attractive. In an 
      aqueous solution, the reaction equilibrium constant of the fumarase-mediated 
      conversion of L-malic acid to fumaric acid is 1:4.2 (fumaric acid to L-malic acid). 
      To shift the reaction equilibrium to fumaric acid, solvent engineering was carried 
      out by varying hydrophilic solvents and their concentrations. Generally, organic 
      solvents may denature fumarase. Therefore, fumarase from Thermus thermophilus was 
      employed to overcome this problem. Ethylene glycol was found more suitable than 
      other solvents. This fumarase was shown to be more stable in 50% than in 70% 
      ethylene glycol. Therefore, a preparation was carried out in 50% ethylene glycol. 
      Under this condition, 54.7% conversion was observed using fumarase for transforming 
      1 mmol L-malic acid. After precipitation by adapting the pH, and washing to remove 
      residual solvent and substrate, 27% total yield was obtained with 99% purity. The 
      results demonstrated that the alternative green route to produce bio-based fumaric 
      acid via L-malic acid is feasible and viable.

TI  - Mixed disulfide formation at Cys141 leads to apparent unidirectional attenuation of 
      Aspergillus niger NADP-glutamate dehydrogenase activity.
PG  - e101662
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0101662 [doi]
LID - e101662
AB  - NADP-Glutamate dehydrogenase from Aspergillus niger (AnGDH) exhibits sigmoid 
      2-oxoglutarate saturation. Incubation with 2-hydroxyethyl disulfide (2-HED, the 
      disulfide of 2-mercaptoethanol) resulted in preferential attenuation of AnGDH 
      reductive amination (forward) activity but with a negligible effect on oxidative 
      deamination (reverse) activity, when monitored in the described standard assay. Such 
      a disulfide modified AnGDH displaying less than 1.0% forward reaction rate could be 
      isolated after 2-HED treatment. This unique forward inhibited GDH form (FIGDH), 
      resembling a hypothetical 'one-way' active enzyme, was characterized. Kinetics of 
      2-HED mediated inhibition and protein thiol titrations suggested that a single thiol 
      group is modified in FIGDH. Two site-directed cysteine mutants, C141S and C415S, 
      were constructed to identify the relevant thiol in FIGDH. The forward activity of 
      C141S alone was insensitive to 2-HED, implicating Cys141 in FIGDH formation. It was 
      observed that FIGDH displayed maximal reaction rate only after a pre-incubation with 
      2-oxoglutarate and NADPH. In addition, compared to the native enzyme, FIGDH showed a 
      four fold increase in K0.5 for 2-oxoglutarate and a two fold increase in the 
      Michaelis constants for ammonium and NADPH. With no change in the GDH reaction 
      equilibrium constant, the FIGDH catalyzed rate of approach to equilibrium from 
      reductive amination side was sluggish. Altered kinetic properties of FIGDH at least 
      partly account for the observed apparent loss of forward activity when monitored 
      under defined assay conditions. In sum, although Cys141 is catalytically not 
      essential, its covalent modification provides a striking example of converting the 
      biosynthetic AnGDH into a catabolic enzyme.

      activity, and facilitates peroxynitrite isomerization. Here, the effect of CL 
      liposomes on the nitrite reductase activity of ferrous cytc (cytc-Fe(II)) is 
      reported. In the absence of CL liposomes, hexa-coordinated cytc-Fe(II) displays a 
      very low value of the apparent second-order rate constant for the NO2 (-)-mediated 
      conversion of cytc-Fe(II) to cytc-Fe(II)-NO (k 
      on = (7.3 ± 0.7) × 10(-2) M(-1) s(-1); at pH 7.4 and 20.0 °C). However, CL liposomes 
      facilitate the NO2 (-)-mediated nitrosylation of cytc-Fe(II) in a dose-dependent 
      manner inducing the penta-coordination of the heme-Fe(II) atom. The value of k on 
      for the NO2 (-)-mediated conversion of CL-cytc-Fe(II) to CL-cytc-Fe(II)-NO is 
      2.6 ± 0.3 M(-1) s(-1) (at pH 7.4 and 20.0 °C). Values of the apparent dissociation 
      equilibrium constant for CL liposomes binding to cytc-Fe(II) are 
      (2.2 ± 0.2) × 10(-6) M, (1.8 ± 0.2) × 10(-6) M, and (1.4 ± 0.2) × 10(-6) M at pH 
      6.5, 7.4, and 8.1, respectively, and 20.0 °C. These results suggest that the NO2 
      (-)-mediated conversion of CL-cytc-Fe(II) to CL-cytc-Fe(II)-NO could play 
      anti-apoptotic effects impairing lipid peroxidation and therefore the initiation of 
      the cell death program by the release of pro-apoptotic factors (including cytc) in 
      the cytoplasm.

AB  - An understanding of the temperature-dependence of solubility of carbon dioxide (CO2) 
      in water is important for many industrial processes. Voluminous work has been done 
      by both quantum chemical methods and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the 
      interaction between CO2 and water, but a quantitative evaluation of solubility 
      remains elusive. In this work, we have approached the problem by considering quantum 
      chemically calculated total energies and thermal energies, and incorporating the 
      effects of mixing, hydrogen bonding, and phonon modes. An overall equation relating 
      the calculated free energy and entropy of mixing with the gas-solution equilibrium 
      constant has been derived. This equation has been iteratively solved to obtain the 
      solubility as functions of temperature and dielectric constant. The calculated 
      solubility versus temperature plot excellently matches the observed plot. Solubility 
      has been shown to increase with dielectric constant, for example, by addition of 
      electrolytes. We have also found that at the experimentally reported concentration 
      of enzyme RuBP in bundle sheath cells of chloroplast in C4 green plants, the 
      concentration of CO2 can effectively increase by as much as a factor of 7.1-38.5. 
      This stands in agreement with the observed effective rise in concentration by as 
      much as 10 times.

TI  - Free energy landscape of lysozyme: multiple near-native conformational states and 
      rollover in the urea dependence of folding energy.
PG  - 6662-9
LID - 10.1021/jp501879s [doi]
AB  - Deviation from linearity of the equilibrium folding free energy (ΔG) of proteins 
      along the reaction coordinate is scarcely known. Optical spectroscopic observables 
      and NMR-measured average molecular dimensional property of lysozyme with urea at pH 
      5 reveal that ΔG rolls over from linearity under mild to strongly native-like 
      conditions. The urea dependence of ΔG is graphed in the 0-7 M range of the 
      denaturant by employing a series of guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl)-induced 
      equilibrium unfolding transitions, each in the presence of a fixed level of urea. 
      The observed linear dependence of ΔG on urea under denaturing conditions begins to 
      deviate as moderately native-like conditions are approached and eventually rolls 
      over under strongly native-like conditions. This is atypical of the upward curvature 
      in the ΔG vs denaturant plot predicted by the denaturant binding model. On 
      increasing the denaturant concentration from 0 to 5 M, the hydrodynamic radius of 
      lysozyme shrinks by ∼2 Å. We suggest subdenaturing levels of urea affect the 
      population distribution among multiple near-native isoenergetic conformational 
      states so as to promote them sequentially with increments of the denaturant. We use 
      a multiple-state sequential model to show that the keel over of ΔG occurs due to 
      these near-native alternative states in the native ensemble used for defining the 
      unfolding equilibrium constant (KU), which we assume to vary linearly with urea. The 
      results and the model appear to indicate a rugged flat bottom in the free energy 
      landscape wherein population distribution of native-like states is modulated by 
      urea-affected interstate motions.

TI  - Pyruvate formate-lyase and its activation by pyruvate formate-lyase activating 
      enzyme.
PG  - 5723-9
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M113.496877 [doi]
AB  - The activation of pyruvate formate-lyase (PFL) by pyruvate formate-lyase activating 
      enzyme (PFL-AE) involves formation of a specific glycyl radical on PFL by the PFL-AE 
      in a reaction requiring S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet). Surface plasmon resonance 
      experiments were performed under anaerobic conditions on the oxygen-sensitive PFL-AE 
      to determine the kinetics and equilibrium constant for its interaction with PFL. 
      These experiments show that the interaction is very slow and rate-limited by large 
      conformational changes. A novel AdoMet binding assay was used to accurately 
      determine the equilibrium constants for AdoMet binding to PFL-AE alone and in 
      complex with PFL. The PFL-AE bound AdoMet with the same affinity (∼6 μM) regardless 
      of the presence or absence of PFL. Activation of PFL in the presence of its 
      substrate pyruvate or the analog oxamate resulted in stoichiometric conversion of 
      the [4Fe-4S](1+) cluster to the glycyl radical on PFL; however, 3.7-fold less 
      activation was achieved in the absence of these small molecules, demonstrating that 
      pyruvate or oxamate are required for optimal activation. Finally, in vivo 
      concentrations of the entire PFL system were calculated to estimate the amount of 
      bound protein in the cell. PFL, PFL-AE, and AdoMet are essentially fully bound in 
      vivo, whereas electron donor proteins are partially bound.

AB  - In the present work, we investigated the inhibitory effects of amoxicillin, a 
      bacteriolytic β-lactam antibiotic drug, on the rate of monophenol hydroxylation and 
      o-diphenol oxidation catalyzed by mushroom tyrosinase. The results showed that 
      amoxicillin could inhibit both monophenolase and diphenolase activities. For 
      monophenolase activity, the inhibition on reaction rate was dose-dependent, while 
      the influence on lag period was not obvious. For diphenolase activity, amoxicillin 
      was found to be a reversible inhibitor, with an IC50 value of 9.0 ± 1.8 mM. Kinetics 
      analysis showed that amoxicillin was a mixed type inhibitor of the enzyme with KI 
      and KIS values of 8.30 mM and 44.79 mM, respectively. Further, the molecular 
      mechanism underlying the inhibition of tyrosinse by amoxicillin was investigated by 
      means of fluorescence quenching and molecular docking techniques. The results showed 
      that amoxicillin could form static interaction with the catalytic pocket of the 
      enzyme through the interaction of amoxicillin with the dicopper irons and amino acid 
      residues in the enzyme active center. Our results contributed to the usage of 
      amoxicillin as a potential tyrosinase inhibitor in the field of medicinal industry 
      and could also provide guidance in the design of novel tyrosinase inhibitors.

AB  - Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is the key enzyme of most food enzymatic oxidation. 
      Tyrosinase inhibitors are important in food industry. In the present paper, 
      2-chlorcinnamic acid and 2,4-dichlorocinnamic acid were synthesized and the 
      inhibitory kinetics on mushroom tyrosinase were investigated. The results showed 
      that both compounds synthesized could inhibit tyrosinase activity. For monophenolase 
      activity, both chlorocinnamic acids could extended the lag time and decrease the 
      steady-state activities, 2-chlorcinnamic acid extended the lag time just by 5%, and 
      2,4-dichlorcinnamic acid extended the lag time more than by 30.4%. For diphenolase 
      activity, the IC50 values of 2-chlorcinnamic acid and 2,4-dichlorocinnamic acid were 
      determined to be 0.765 mM and 0.295 mM, respectively. The inhibition kinetics showed 
      that 2-chlorcinnamic acid and 2,4-dichlorocinnamic acid displayed a reversible and 
      uncompetitive mechanism. The inhibition constants were determined to be 0.348 mM and 
      0.159 mM, respectively. The research may supply the basis for designing new 
      tyrosinase inhibitors.

TI  - Temperature invariance of the nitrogenase electron transfer mechanism.
PG  - 8391-8
LID - 10.1021/bi301164j [doi]
AB  - Earlier studies of electron transfer (ET) from the nitrogenase Fe protein to the 
      MoFe protein concluded that the mechanism for ET changed during cooling from 25 to 5 
      °C, based on the observation that the rate constant for Fe protein to MoFe protein 
      ET decreases strongly, with a nonlinear Arrhenius plot. They further indicated that 
      the ET was reversible, with complete ET at ambient temperature but with an 
      equilibrium constant near unity at 5 °C. These studies were conducted with buffers 
      having a strong temperature coefficient. We have examined the temperature variation 
      in the kinetics of oxidation of the Fe protein by the MoFe protein at a constant pH 
      of 7.4 fixed by the buffer 3-(N-morpholino)propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), which has a 
      very small temperature coefficient. Using MOPS, we also observe 
      temperature-dependent ET rate constants, with nonlinear Arrhenius plots, but we find 
      that ET is gated across the temperature range by a conformational change that 
      involves the binding of numerous water molecules, consistent with an unchanging ET 
      mechanism. Furthermore, there is no solvent kinetic isotope effect throughout the 
      temperature range studied, again consistent with an unchanging mechanism. In 
      addition, the nonlinear Arrhenius plots are explained by the change in heat capacity 
      caused by the binding of waters in an invariant gating ET mechanism. Together, these 
      observations contradict the idea of a change in ET mechanism with cooling. Finally, 
      the extent of ET at constant pH does not change significantly with temperature, in 
      contrast to the previously proposed change in ET equilibrium.

TI  - Proton transfer from C-6 of uridine 5'-monophosphate catalyzed by orotidine 
      5'-monophosphate decarboxylase: formation and stability of a vinyl carbanion 
      intermediate and the effect of a 5-fluoro substituent.
PG  - 14580-94
LID - 10.1021/ja3058474 [doi]
AB  - The exchange for deuterium of the C-6 protons of uridine 5'-monophosphate (UMP) and 
      5-fluorouridine 5'-monophosphate (F-UMP) catalyzed by yeast orotidine 
      5'-monophosphate decarboxylase (ScOMPDC) at pD 6.5-9.3 and 25 °C was monitored by 
      (1)H NMR spectroscopy. Deuterium exchange proceeds by proton transfer from C-6 of 
      the bound nucleotide to the deprotonated side chain of Lys-93 to give the 
      enzyme-bound vinyl carbanion. The pD-rate profiles for k(cat) give turnover numbers 
      for deuterium exchange into enzyme-bound UMP and F-UMP of 1.2 × 10(-5) and 0.041 
      s(-1), respectively, so that the 5-fluoro substituent results in a 3400-fold 
      increase in the first-order rate constant for deuterium exchange. The binding of UMP 
      and F-UMP to ScOMPDC results in 0.5 and 1.4 unit decreases, respectively, in the 
      pK(a) of the side chain of the catalytic base Lys-93, showing that these nucleotides 
      bind preferentially to the deprotonated enzyme. We also report the first carbon acid 
      pK(a) values for proton transfer from C-6 of uridine (pK(CH) = 28.8) and 
      5-fluorouridine (pK(CH) = 25.1) in aqueous solution. The stabilizing effects of the 
      5-fluoro substituent on C-6 carbanion formation in solution (5 kcal/mol) and at 
      ScOMPDC (6 kcal/mol) are similar. The binding of UMP and F-UMP to ScOMPDC results in 
      a greater than 5 × 10(9)-fold increase in the equilibrium constant for proton 
      transfer from C-6, so that ScOMPDC stabilizes the bound vinyl carbanions, relative 
      to the bound nucleotides, by at least 13 kcal/mol. The pD-rate profile for 
      k(cat)/K(m) for deuterium exchange into F-UMP gives the intrinsic second-order rate 
      constant for exchange catalyzed by the deprotonated enzyme as 2300 M(-1) s(-1). This 
      was used to calculate a total rate acceleration for ScOMPDC-catalyzed deuterium 
      exchange of 3 × 10(10) M(-1), which corresponds to a transition-state stabilization 
      for deuterium exchange of 14 kcal/mol. We conclude that a large portion of the total 
      transition-state stabilization for the decarboxylation of orotidine 5'-monophosphate 
      can be accounted for by stabilization of the enzyme-bound vinyl carbanion 
      intermediate of the stepwise reaction.

TI  - Substrate kinetics and substrate effects on the quaternary structure of barley 
      UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase.
PG  - 39-45
LID - 10.1016/j.phytochem.2012.04.002 [doi]
AB  - UDP-Glc pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) is an essential enzyme responsible for production 
      of UDP-Glc, which is used in hundreds of glycosylation reactions involving addition 
      of Glc to a variety of compounds. In this study, barley UGPase was characterized 
      with respect to effects of its substrates on activity and quaternary structure of 
      the protein. Its K(m) values with Glc-1-P and UTP were 0.33 and 0.25 mM, 
      respectively. Besides using Glc-1-P as a substrate, the enzyme had also considerable 
      activity with Gal-1-P; however, the K(m) for Gal-1-P was very high (>10 mM), 
      rendering this reaction unlikely under physiological conditions. UGPase had a 
      relatively broad pH optimum of 6.5-8.5, regardless of the direction of reaction. The 
      enzyme equilibrium constant was 0.4, suggesting slight preference for the Glc-1-P 
      synthesis direction of the reaction. The quaternary structure of the enzyme, studied 
      by Gas-phase Electrophoretic Mobility Macromolecule Analysis (GEMMA), was affected 
      by addition of either single or both substrates in either direction of the reaction, 
      resulting in a shift from UGPase dimers toward monomers, the active form of the 
      enzyme. The substrate-induced changes in quaternary structure of the enzyme may have 
      a regulatory role to assure maximal activity. Kinetics and factors affecting the 
      oligomerization status of UGPase are discussed.

AB  - Fuculose-1-phosphate aldolase (FucA) is a useful biocatalyst with potential 
      applications in chiral synthesis. In this study, the overall kinetic mechanism of 
      FucA from the archaeon Methanococcus jannaschii was studied. The K(m) values of 
      dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) and dl-glyceraldehyde were 0.09 and 0.74 mM, 
      respectively. Dead-end inhibition by trimethyl phosphonoacetate and dl-threose were 
      competitive and uncompetitive with respect to DHAP and dl-glyceraldehyde. Inhibition 
      patterns obtained using reaction products were noncompetitive vs. DHAP and 
      competitive vs. dl-glyceraldehyde. The equilibrium constant was 8.309×10(-3) M as 
      assessed by varying the [DHAP]/[product] ratio at a fixed dl-glyceraldehyde 
      concentration and by measuring the change in DHAP concentration after equilibrium 
      was reached. This constant is consistent with the K(eq) value obtained from (13)C 
      NMR (15.625×10(-3) M). The resultant inhibition kinetics may suggest the insights of 
      kinetic mechanism of the FucA catalyzed reaction.

PG  - 2159-62
LID - 10.1002/bit.24472 [doi]
AB  - The equilibrium constant is a critical parameter for making rational design choices 
      in biocatalytic transamination for the synthesis of chiral amines. However, very few 
      reports are available in the scientific literature determining the equilibrium 
      constant (K) for the transamination of ketones. Various methods for determining (or 
      estimating) equilibrium have previously been suggested, both experimental as well as 
      computational (based on group contribution methods). However, none of these were 
      found suitable for determining the equilibrium constant for the transamination of 
      ketones. Therefore, in this communication we suggest a simple experimental 
      methodology which we hope will stimulate more accurate determination of 
      thermodynamic equilibria when reporting the results of transaminase-catalyzed 
      reactions in order to increase understanding of the relationship between substrate 
      and product molecular structure on reaction thermodynamics.

AB  - Rate constants and activation parameters have been determined for the internal 
      electron transfer from type 1 (T1) to type 3 (T3) copper ions in laccase from both 
      the fungus Trametes hirsuta and the lacquer tree Rhus vernicifera, using the pulse 
      radiolysis method. The rate constant at 298 K and the enthalpy and entropy of 
      activation were 25 ± 1 s(-1), 39.7 ± 5.0 kJ·mol(-1) and -87 ± 9 J·mol(-1) ·K(-1) for 
      the fungal enzyme and 1.1 ± 0.1 s(-1), 9.8 ± 0.2 kJ·mol(-1) and -211 ± 3 J·mol(-1) 
      ·K(-1) for the tree enzyme. The initial reduction of the T1 site by pulse 
      radiolytically produced radicals was direct in the case of T. hirsuta laccase, but 
      occured indirectly via a disulfide radical in R. vernicifera. The equilibrium 
      constant that characterizes the electron transfer from T1 to T3 copper ions was 0.4 
      for T. hirsuta laccase and 1.5 for R. vernicifera laccase, leading to full reduction 
      of the T1 site occurring at 2.9 ± 0.2 electron equivalents for T. hirsuta and 4 
      electron equivalents for R. vernicifera laccase. These results were compared with 
      each other and with those for the same process in other multicopper oxidases, 
      ascorbate oxidase and Streptomyces coelicolor laccase, using available structural 
      information and electron transfer theory.

TI  - Phenol group in pyridoxamine acts as a stabilizing element for its carbinolamines 
      and Schiff bases.
PG  - 1318-32
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.201000296 [doi]
AB  - Pyridoxamine (PM), a natural derivative of vitamin B(6) , possesses a high 
      biological and biomedical significance by virtue of its acting as enzyme cofactor in 
      amino acid metabolism and as inhibitor in the nonenzymatic glycation of proteins. 
      Both types of processes require the initial formation of a Schiff base. In this 
      work, we used NMR spectroscopy to study the formation mechanism for a Schiff base 
      between PM and formaldehyde (FA). This allowed the Schiff base and an intermediate 
      carbinolamine (CA) to be detected. The Schiff base was found to be in isomeric 
      equilibrium with a hemiaminal (HE) form. The formation equilibrium constants for the 
      CA and HE over the pD range of 6.0-13.0 were determined and compared with those for 
      the reaction between 4-picolylamine (PAM) and formaldehyde (FA). The comparison 
      revealed a strong influence of the phenol group on the equilibrium constant. Based 
      on the results, the phenol group in PM is a key structural element towards 
      stabilizing the resulting carbinolamine and Schiff base.

TI  - Rewiring hydrogenase-dependent redox circuits in cyanobacteria.
PG  - 3941-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1016026108 [doi]
AB  - Hydrogenases catalyze the reversible reaction 2H(+) + 2e(-) ↔ H(2) with an 
      equilibrium constant that is dependent on the reducing potential of electrons 
      carried by their redox partner. To examine the possibility of increasing the 
      photobiological production of hydrogen within cyanobacterial cultures, we expressed 
      the [FeFe] hydrogenase, HydA, from Clostridium acetobutylicum in the 
      non-nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus sp. 7942. We demonstrate 
      that the heterologously expressed hydrogenase is functional in vitro and in vivo, 
      and that the in vivo hydrogenase activity is connected to the light-dependent 
      reactions of the electron transport chain. Under anoxic conditions, HydA activity is 
      capable of supporting light-dependent hydrogen evolution at a rate > 500-fold 
      greater than that supported by the endogenous [NiFe] hydrogenase. Furthermore, HydA 
      can support limited growth solely using H(2) and light as the source of reducing 
      equivalents under conditions where Photosystem II is inactivated. Finally, we 
      demonstrate that the addition of exogenous ferredoxins can modulate redox flux in 
      the hydrogenase-expressing strain, allowing for greater hydrogen yields and for dark 
      fermentation of internal energy stores into hydrogen gas.

TI  - Kinetic and chemical mechanism of the dihydrofolate reductase from Mycobacterium 
      tuberculosis.
PG  - 367-75
AB  - Dihydrofolate reductase from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MtDHFR) catalyzes the 
      NAD(P)-dependent reduction of dihydrofolate, yielding NAD(P)(+) and 
      tetrahydrofolate, the primary one-carbon unit carrier in biology. Tetrahydrofolate 
      needs to be recycled so that reactions involved in dTMP synthesis and purine 
      metabolism are maintained. In this work, we report the kinetic characterization of 
      the MtDHFR. This enzyme has a sequential steady-state random kinetic mechanism, 
      probably with a preferred pathway with NADPH binding first. A pK(a) value for an 
      enzymic acid of approximately 7.0 was identified from the pH dependence of V, and 
      the analysis of the primary kinetic isotope effects revealed that the hydride 
      transfer step is at least partly rate-limiting throughout the pH range analyzed. 
      Additionally, solvent and multiple kinetic isotope effects were determined and 
      analyzed, and equilibrium isotope effects were measured on the equilibrium constant. 
      (D(2)O)V and (D(2)O)V/K([4R-4-(2)H]NADH) were slightly inverse at pH 6.0, and 
      inverse values for (D(2)O)V([4R-4-(2)H]NADH) and (D(2)O)V/K([4R-4-(2)H]NADH) 
      suggested that a pre-equilibrium protonation is occurring before the hydride 
      transfer step, indicating a stepwise mechanism for proton and hydride transfer. The 
      same value was obtained for (D)k(H) at pH 5.5 and 7.5, reaffirming the rate-limiting 
      nature of the hydride transfer step. A chemical mechanism is proposed on the basis 
      of the results obtained here.

TI  - The Cys319 loop modulates the transition between dehydrogenase and hydrolase 
      conformations in inosine 5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase.
PG  - 10674-81
LID - 10.1021/bi101590c [doi]
AB  - X-ray crystal structures of enzyme-ligand complexes are widely believed to mimic 
      states in the catalytic cycle, but this presumption has seldom been carefully 
      scrutinized. In the case of Tritrichomonas foetus inosine 5'-monophosphate 
      dehydrogenase (IMPDH), 10 structures of various enzyme-substrate-inhibitor complexes 
      have been determined. The Cys319 loop is found in at least three different 
      conformations, suggesting that its conformation changes as the catalytic cycle 
      progresses from the dehydrogenase step to the hydrolase reaction. Alternatively, 
      only one conformation of the Cys319 loop may be catalytically relevant while the 
      others are off-pathway. Here we differentiate between these two hypotheses by 
      analyzing the effects of Ala substitutions at three residues of the Cys319 loop, 
      Arg322, Glu323, and Gln324. These mutations have minimal effects on the value of 
      k(cat) (≤5-fold) that obscure large effects (>10-fold) on the microscopic rate 
      constants for individual steps. These substitutions increase the equilibrium 
      constant for the dehydrogenase step but decrease the equilibrium between open and 
      closed conformations of a mobile flap. More dramatic effects are observed when 
      Arg322 is substituted with Glu, which decreases the rates of hydride transfer and 
      hydrolysis by factors of 2000 and 130, respectively. These experiments suggest that 
      the Cys319 loop does indeed have different conformations during the dehydrogenase 
      and hydrolase reactions as suggested by the crystal structures. Importantly, these 
      experiments reveal that the structure of the Cys319 loop modulates the closure of 
      the mobile flap. This conformational change converts the enzyme from a dehydrogenase 
      into hydrolase, suggesting that the conformation of the Cys319 loop may gate the 
      catalytic cycle.

PG  - 16137-46
LID - 10.1021/jp105723r [doi]
AB  - The apparent equilibrium constants, K′, of biochemical reactions containing 
      substrates which bind [Mg2+] unequally can be significantly altered by changes in 
      free intracellular [Mg2+]. Intracellular free [Mg2+] can be estimated by 
      measurements of [citrate]/[isocitrate], a ratio known to vary with tissue free 
      [Mg2+]. The combined equilibrium constant for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate 
      dehydrogenase, phosphoglycerate kinase, and triose phosphate isomerase for the three 
      reactions (K(GG-TPI)′) was corrected using new binding constants for 
      dihydroxyacetone-phosphate and 3-phosphoglycerate. The result of this calculation is 
      demonstrated in the calculation of the free energy of ATP hydrolysis. In addition, 
      the dependence of the equilibrium constant for the glutamine synthetase reaction on 
      pH and free [Mg2+] was demonstrated. Furthermore, a theory linking the ΔG′ value of 
      mitochondrial complex I−II and the cytosolic ΔG′ value of ATP hydrolysis is 
      discussed with evidence from previous publications.

TI  - Carboxyl pK(a) values and acid denaturation of BBL.
PG  - 313-27
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2010.08.052 [doi]
AB  - The protein BBL undergoes structural transitions and acid denaturation between pH 
      1.2 and 8.0. Using NMR spectroscopy, we measured the pK(a) values of all the 
      carboxylic residues in this pH range. We employed (13)C direct-detection 
      two-dimensional IPAP (in-phase antiphase) CACO NMR spectroscopy to monitor the 
      ionization state of different carboxylic groups and demonstrated its advantages over 
      other NMR techniques in measuring pK(a) values of carboxylic residues. The two 
      residues Glu161 and Asp162 had significantly lowered pK(a) values, showing that 
      these residues are involved in a network of stabilizing electrostatic interactions, 
      as is His166. The other carboxylates had unperturbed values. The pH dependence of 
      the free energy of denaturation was described quantitatively by the ionizations of 
      those three residues of perturbed pK(a), and, using thermodynamic cycles, we could 
      calculate their pK(a)s in the native and denatured states as well as the equilibrium 
      constants for denaturation of the different protonation states. We also measured 
      (13)C(α) chemical shifts of individual residues as a function of pH. These shifts 
      sense structural transitions rather than ionizations, and they titrated with pH 
      consistent with the change in equilibrium constant for denaturation. Kinetic 
      measurements of the folding of BBL E161Q indicated that, at pH 7, the stabilizing 
      interactions with Glu161 are formed mainly in the transition state. We also found 
      that local interactions still exist in the acid-denatured state of BBL, which 
      attenuate somewhat the flexibility of the acid-denatured state.

      (Litopenaeus vannamei).
PG  - 674-8
LID - 10.1016/j.fsi.2010.07.004 [doi]
AB  - NAGase (EC.3.2.1.52) from crustaceans has the important roles in immunity, molting 
      and digestion of chitinous foods. In this paper, the effects of citric acid on the 
      activity of NAGase from Litopenaeus vannamei for the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG have been 
      studied. The results showed that appropriate concentrations of citric acid could 
      lead to reversible inhibition on NAGase and IC(50) was estimated to be 5.00 +/- 0.35 
      mM. Using the plots of Lineweaver-Burk, the inhibition of NAGase by citric acid 
      belongs to competitive type, the inhibitory equilibrium constant for citric acid 
      binding with free NAGase, K(I), is 3.26 +/- 0.25 mM. The inhibitory kinetics of 
      citric acid on NAGase in the appropriate concentrations of citric acid has been 
      studied using the kinetic method of substrate reaction. The time course of NAGase 
      for the hydrolysis of pNP-NAG in the presence of different concentrations of citric 
      acid showed that at each citric acid concentration, the rate decreased with 
      increasing time until a straight line was approached. The results show that the 
      inhibition of NAGase by citric acid is a slow, reversible reaction with fractional 
      remaining activity. The microscopic rate constants are determined for the reaction 
      on citric acid with NAGase.

TI  - The human estrogen sulfotransferase: a half-site reactive enzyme.
PG  - 4779-85
LID - 10.1021/bi902190r [doi]
AB  - The affinity of 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) for the estrogen receptor is weakened beyond 
      the point of physiological relevance by the transfer of the sulfuryl moiety (-SO(3)) 
      from PAPS (3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate) to the 3'-hydroxyl of E(2). The 
      mechanism of this transfer reaction, catalyzed by estrogen sulfotransferase (EST), 
      is investigated here in detail. The enzyme (a dimer of identical protomers) presents 
      a clear example of half-sites reactivity--only one of the subunits of the dimer 
      produces product during the catalytic cycle. This is the first example of half-sites 
      reactivity in the sulfotransferase family. A burst of product, with an amplitude 
      that corresponds to one-half of the available active sites, reveals that the 
      mechanism is rate-limited by product release. The equilibrium constant governing 
      interconversion of the substrate (E.PAPS.E(2)) and product (E.PAP.E(2)S) central 
      complexes was determined and is strongly biased toward product (K(eq int) 
      approximately 49). Slow product release allows the interconversion of the central 
      complexes to approach equilibrium, with the result that K(eq int) becomes nearly 
      linearly coupled to K(m) and contributes a factor of approximately 30 to the 
      steady-state affinity of the enzyme for substrate. Typical of its family, estrogen 
      sulfotransferase is partially k(cat)-inhibited by its acceptor substrate, E(2). This 
      inhibition does not influence the burst kinetics and thus occurs after formation of 
      the product central complex, a finding consistent with the slow escape of PAP from 
      the nonreactive E.PAP.E(2) complex.

TI  - Kinetic mechanism for the flipping and excision of 1,N(6)-ethenoadenine by human 
      alkyladenine DNA glycosylase.
PG  - 11357-69
LID - 10.1021/bi9015082 [doi]
AB  - Human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase initiates the repair of a wide variety of 
      alkylated and deaminated purine lesions in DNA. In this study, we take advantage of 
      the natural fluorescence of the 1,N(6)-ethenoadenosine (epsilonA) lesion and report 
      a kinetic analysis of binding, nucleotide flipping, base excision, and product 
      release. The transient changes in the fluorescence of epsilonA revealed the 
      existence of two distinct complexes that are formed prior to the hydrolysis step. An 
      initial recognition complex forms rapidly and is characterized by partial disruption 
      of the stacking interactions of the lesioned base. Subsequently, a very stable 
      extrahelical complex is formed in which the epsilonA lesion is strongly quenched by 
      interactions in the AAG active site pocket. Our results indicate that DNA binding 
      and base flipping take place on the millisecond to second time scale. N-Glycosidic 
      bond cleavage is much slower, taking place on the minute time scale. A pulse-chase 
      experiment was used to demonstrate that even for the tightly bound epsilonA 
      substrate, the extrahelical complex is not fully committed to excision. 
      Nevertheless, flipping of epsilonA is highly favorable, and we calculate that the 
      equilibrium constant for flipping is approximately 1300. This kinetic mechanism has 
      important biological implications. First, two-step binding provides multiple 
      opportunities to discriminate between damaged and undamaged nucleotides. Second, a 
      rapid equilibrium flipping mechanism maximizes specificity for damaged versus 
      undamaged bases, since undamaged bases generally form stronger base pairs than 
      damaged bases. Finally, the highly favorable equilibrium for flipping of epsilonA 
      ensures that epsilonA removal is independent of sequence context and highly 
      efficient despite the relatively slow rate of N-glycosidic bond hydrolysis.

TI  - Structure and reaction mechanism of human nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase.
PG  - 95-107
LID - 10.1093/jb/mvp152 [doi]
AB  - Nicotinamide (NM) phosphoribosyltransferase (NMPRTase) catalyzes the reaction of NM 
      and 5'-phosphoribosyl-1'-pyrophosphate (PRPP) to form NM mononucleotide (NMN) and 
      pyrophosphate (PPi) in the pathway of NAD-biosynthesis. Monitoring the (1)H and 
      (31)P NMR spectra of the reaction mixture, we found that this reaction is reversible 
      as dictated by the equilibrium constant K = [NMN][PPi]/([NM][PRPP]) = 0.14, which 
      agreed well with the ratio of second-order rate constants for forward and backward 
      reactions, K = 0.16. The crystal structures of this enzyme in the free form and 
      bound to NM and PRPP at the resolution of 2.0-2.2 A were essentially identical to 
      that of the complex with NMN, except for some variations that could facilitate the 
      substitution reaction by fixing the nucleophile and the leaving group for the 
      requisite inversion of configuration at the C1' carbon of the ribose ring. In the 
      active site near the C1' atom of the bound PRPP or NMN, there was neither negatively 
      charged group nor waterproof environment necessary to support the feasibility of a 
      ribo-oxocarbocation intermediate inherent in the S(N)1 mechanism. The structures and 
      catalytic mechanism thus revealed are also discussed in connection with the multiple 
      biological functions of NMPRTase.

TI  - Bifunctional cytosolic UDP-glucose 4-epimerases catalyse the interconversion between 
      UDP-D-xylose and UDP-L-arabinose in plants.
PG  - 169-77
LID - 10.1042/BJ20091025 [doi]
AB  - UDP-sugars serve as substrates in the synthesis of cell wall polysaccharides and are 
      themselves generated through sequential interconversion reactions from UDP-Glc 
      (UDP-glucose) as the starting substrate in the cytosol and the Golgi apparatus. For 
      the present study, a soluble enzyme with UDP-Xyl (UDP-xylose) 4-epimerase activity 
      was purified approx. 300-fold from pea (Pisum sativum L.) sprouts by conventional 
      chromatography. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the enzyme revealed that it is 
      encoded by a predicted UDP-Glc 4-epimerase gene, PsUGE1, and is distinct from the 
      UDP-Xyl 4-epimerase localized in the Golgi apparatus. rPsUGE1 (recombinant P. 
      sativum UGE1) expressed in Escherichia coli exhibited both UDP-Xyl 4-epimerase and 
      UDP-Glc 4-epimerase activities with apparent Km values of 0.31, 0.29, 0.16 and 0.15 
      mM for UDP-Glc, UDP-Gal (UDP-galactose), UDP-Ara (UDP-L-arabinose) and UDP-Xyl 
      respectively. The apparent equilibrium constant for UDP-Ara formation from UDP-Xyl 
      was 0.89, whereas that for UDP-Gal formation from UDP-Glc was 0.24. Phylogenetic 
      analysis revealed that PsUGE1 forms a group with Arabidopsis UDP-Glc 4-epimerases, 
      AtUGE1 and AtUGE3, apart from a group including AtUGE2, AtUGE4 and AtUGE5. Similar 
      to rPsUGE1, recombinant AtUGE1 and AtUGE3 expressed in E. coli showed high UDP-Xyl 
      4-epimerase activity in addition to their UDP-Glc 4-epimerase activity. Our results 
      suggest that PsUGE1 and its close homologues catalyse the interconversion between 
      UDP-Xyl and UDP-Ara as the last step in the cytosolic de novo pathway for UDP-Ara 
      generation. Alternatively, the net flux of metabolites may be from UDP-Ara to 
      UDP-Xyl as part of the salvage pathway for Ara.

TI  - Chiral catalysts dually functionalized with amino acid and Zn2+ complex components 
      for enantioselective direct aldol reactions inspired by natural aldolases: design, 
      synthesis, complexation properties, catalytic activities, and mechanistic study.
PG  - 10570-84

AB  - Aldolases are enzymes that catalyze stereospecific aldol reactions in a reversible 
      manner. Naturally occurring aldolases include class I aldolases, which catalyze 
      aldol reactions via enamine intermediates, and class II aldolases, in which Zn(2+) 
      enolates of substrates react with acceptor aldehydes. In this work, Zn(2+) complexes 
      of L-prolyl-pendant[15]aneN(5) (ZnL(3)), L-prolyl-pendant[12]aneN(4) (ZnL(4)), and 
      L-valyl-pendant[12]aneN(4) (ZnL(5)) were designed and synthesized for use as chiral 
      catalysts for enantioselective aldol reactions. The complexation constants for L(3) 
      to L(5) with Zn(2+) [logK(s)(ZnL)] were determined to be 14.1 (for ZnL(3)), 7.6 (for 
      ZnL(4)), and 9.6 (for ZnL(5)), indicating that ZnL(3) is more stable than ZnL(4) and 
      ZnL(5). The deprotonation constants of Zn(2+)-bound water [pK(a)(ZnL) values] for 
      ZnL(3), ZnL(4), and ZnL(5) were calculated to be 9.2 (for ZnL(3)), 8.2 (for ZnL(4)), 
      and 8.6 (for ZnL(5)), suggesting that the Zn(2+) ions in ZnL(3) is a less acidic 
      Lewis acid than in ZnL(4) and ZnL(5). These values also indicated that the amino 
      groups on the side chains weakly coordinate to Zn(2+). We carried out aldol 
      reactions between acetone and 2-chlorobenzaldehyde and other aldehydes in the 
      presence of catalytic amounts of the chiral Zn(2+) complexes in acetone/H(2)O at 25 
      and 37 degrees C. Whereas ZnL(3) yielded the aldol product in 43% yield and 1% ee 
      (R), ZnL(4) and ZnL(5) afforded good chemical yields and high enantioselectivities 
      of up to 89% ee (R). UV titrations of proline and ZnL(4) with acetylacetone (acac) 
      in DMSO/H(2)O (1:2) indicate that ZnL(4) facilitates the formation of the 
      ZnL(4)(acac)(-) complex (K(app)=2.1x10(2) M(-1)), whereas L-proline forms a Schiff 
      base with acac with a very small equilibrium constant. These results suggest that 
      the amino acid components and the Zn(2+) ions in ZnL(4) and ZnL(5) function in a 
      cooperative manner to generate the Zn(2+)-enolate of acetone, thus permitting 
      efficient enantioselective C-C bond formation with aldehydes.

AB  - We present here a kinetic characterization of the oxidation of the artificial 
      substrate 2,3-dihydro-2,5-dihydroxy-4H-benzopyran-4-one in the presence of NADP(+) 
      by trihydroxynaphthalene reductase from the filamentous fungus Curvularia lunata. 
      Although the experimental data were gathered by conventional equipment and were only 
      available for the reaction in one direction, the analysis confirms the bi-bi 
      reaction mechanism and yields estimates of kinetic parameters of the intermediates. 
      It is based on an independent estimation of coenzyme binding constants and on a 
      sequential analysis of three portions of the progress curves, from the beginning of 
      the reaction until equilibrium is reached. First, the plateaus are used to determine 
      the overall equilibrium constant of the non-catalyzed reaction. Then, the 
      dissociation constants of the oxidized and reduced cofactor are estimated by 
      titration. Subsequently, the initial parts of the progress curves are analyzed using 
      the rate equation that is derived under combined assumptions of equilibrium and 
      steady state. The macroscopic relations obtained are then fixed in the final 
      progress curve analysis where the information for only two remaining rate constants 
      is extracted from their curved portions by fitting numerically solved model-specific 
      differential equations to the data. At pH 8, the overall equilibrium largely favours 
      the oxidized substrate and reduced cofactor, and the activity of the holoenzyme is 
      inhibited by high substrate concentrations. Substrate inhibition can be 
      discriminated from true cooperativity through the effects of apigenin, a flavonoid 
      inhibitor that is structurally similar, but larger, than the substrate used in the 
      study.

TI  - Activity of yeast alcohol dehydrogenases on benzyl alcohols and benzaldehydes: 
      characterization of ADH1 from Saccharomyces carlsbergensis and transition state 
      analysis.
PG  - 16-23
LID - 10.1016/j.cbi.2008.10.037 [doi]
AB  - The substrate specificities of yeast alcohol dehydrogenases I and II from 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SceADH1 and SceADH2) and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis 
      (ScbADH1) were studied. For this work, the gene for the S. carlsbergensis ADH1 was 
      cloned, sequenced and expressed. The amino acid sequence of ScbADH1 differs at four 
      positions as compared to SceADH1, including substitutions of two glutamine residues 
      with glutamic acid residues, and has the same sequence as the commercial yeast 
      enzyme, which apparently is prepared from S. carlsbergensis. The electrophoretic 
      mobilities of ScbADH1, SceADH2 and commercial ADH are similar. The kinetics and 
      specificities of ScbADH1 and SceADH1 acting on branched, long-chain and benzyl 
      alcohols are very similar, but the catalytic efficiency of SceADH2 is about 
      10-100-fold higher on these substrates. A three-dimensional structure of SceADH1 
      shows that the substrate binding pocket has Met-270, whereas SceADH2 has Leu-270, 
      which allows larger substrates to bind. The reduction of a series of p-substituted 
      benzaldehydes catalyzed by SceADH2 is significantly enhanced by electron-withdrawing 
      groups, whereas the oxidation of p-substituted aromatic alcohols may be only 
      slightly affected by the substituents. The substituent effects on catalysis 
      generally reflect the effects on the equilibrium constant for the reaction, where 
      electron-withdrawing substituents favor alcohol. The results are consistent with a 
      transition state that is electronically similar to the alcohol, supporting previous 
      results obtained with commercial yeast ADH.

TI  - Overall kinetic mechanism of saccharopine dehydrogenase (L-glutamate forming) from 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 5417-23
LID - 10.1021/bi800086g [doi]
AB  - Kinetic studies were carried out for histidine-tagged saccharopine reductase from 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae at pH 7.0, suggesting a sequential mechanism with ordered 
      addition of reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) to the free 
      enzyme followed by L-alpha-aminoadipate-delta-semialdehyde ( L-AASA) which adds in 
      rapid equilibrium prior to l-glutamate in the forward reaction direction. In the 
      reverse reaction direction, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) adds 
      to the enzyme followed by addition of saccharopine. Product inhibition by NADP is 
      competitive vs NADPH and noncompetitive vs alpha-AASA and L-glutamate, suggesting 
      that the dinucleotide adds to the free enzyme prior to the aldehyde. Saccharopine is 
      noncompetitive vs NADPH, alpha-AASA, and L-glutamate. In the direction of 
      saccharopine oxidation, NADPH is competitive vs NADP and noncompetitive vs 
      saccharopine, L-glutamate is noncompetitive vs both NADP and saccharopine, while 
      L-AASA is noncompetitive vs saccharopine and uncompetitive vs NADP. The sequential 
      mechanism is also corroborated by dead-end inhibition studies using analogues of 
      AASA, L-glutamate, and saccharopine. 2-Amino-6-heptenoic acid was chosen as a 
      dead-end analogue of L-AASA and is competitive vs AASA, uncompetitive vs NADPH, and 
      noncompetitive vs L-glutamate. alpha-Ketoglutarate (alpha-Kg) serves as the dead-end 
      analogue of L-glutamate and is competitive vs L-glutamate and uncompetitive vs 
      L-AASA and NADPH. In the direction of saccharopine oxidation, N-oxalylglycine, 
      L-pipecolic acid, L-leucine, alpha-ketoglutarate, glyoxylic acid, and L-ornithine 
      were used as dead-end analogues of saccharopine and showed competitive inhibition vs 
      saccharopine and uncompetitive inhibition vs NADP. The equilibrium constant for the 
      reaction was measured at pH 7.0 by monitoring the change in absorbance of NADPH and 
      is 200 M(-1). The value is in good agreement with the value determined using the 
      Haldane relationship.

TI  - Molecular and kinetic characterization of two UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylases, 
      products of distinct genes, from Arabidopsis.
PG  - 967-72
LID - 10.1016/j.bbapap.2008.02.021 [doi]
AB  - UDP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (UGPase) is an important enzyme in the production (and 
      conversions) of UDP-glucose, a key precursor for carbohydrate biosynthesis. cDNAs 
      corresponding to two UGPase isozymes in Arabidopsis were overexpressed in 
      Escherichia coli and, subsequently, the recombinant proteins were purified and 
      characterized. Both proteins were highly conserved, sharing 93% identity. Based on 
      crystal structure-derived images, the main amino acid differences mapped to N- and 
      C-termini domains, but not to central active site region. The two proteins existed 
      mainly as monomers, and they had similar molecular masses of ca. 53 kDa. However, 
      comparison of molecular masses of UGPases from Arabidopsis root and leaf extracts 
      revealed that the root protein was slightly larger, suggesting a post-translational 
      modification. Specific activity of the purified UGPase-1 was ca. 10-30% lower than 
      that of UGPase-2, depending on direction of the reaction, whereas its K(m) values 
      with all substrates in both directions of the reaction were consistently ca. twice 
      lower than those of UGPase-2 (0.03-0.14 mM vs. 0.07-0.36 mM, respectively). Both 
      proteins were "true" UGPases, and had no activity with ADP-glucose/ATP or 
      galactose-1-P. Equilibrium constant for both proteins was ca. 0.3, suggesting 
      preference for the pyrophosphorolysis direction of the reaction. The data are 
      discussed with respect to potential roles of UGPase in carbohydrate 
      synthesis/metabolism in Arabidopsis.

TI  - Properties of serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase purified from Arabidopsis thaliana 
      leaves.
PG  - 102-10
AB  - The photorespiratory enzyme L-serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase (SGAT; EC 2.6.1.45) 
      was purified from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves. The final enzyme was approximately 
      80% pure as revealed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis 
      with silver staining. The identity of the enzyme was confirmed by LC/MS/MS analysis. 
      The molecular mass estimated by gel filtration chromatography on Sephadex G-150 
      under non-denaturing conditions, mass spectrometry (matrix-assisted laser 
      desorption/ionization/time of flight technique) and sodium dodecyl 
      sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis was 82.4 kDa, 42.0 kDa, and 39.8 kDa, 
      respectively, indicating dimer as the active form. The optimum pH value was 9.2. The 
      enzyme activity was inhibited by aminooxyacetate and beta-chloro-L-alanine both 
      compounds reacting with the carbonyl group of pyridoxal phosphate. The enzyme's 
      transaminating activity with L-alanine and glyoxylate as substrates was 
      approximately 55% of that observed with L-serine and glyoxylate. The lower Km value 
      (1.25 mM) for L-alanine, compared with that of other plant SGATs, and the 
      kcat/Km(Ala) ratio being approximately 2-fold higher than kcat/Km(Ser) suggested 
      that, during photorespiration, Ala and Ser are used by Arabidopsis SGAT with equal 
      efficiency as amino group donors for glyoxylate. The equilibrium constant (Keq), 
      derived from the Haldane relation, for the transamination reaction between L-serine 
      and glyoxylate with the formation of hydroxypyruvate and glycine was 79.1, strongly 
      favoring glycine synthesis. However, it was accompanied by a low Km value of 2.83 mM 
      for glycine. A comparison of some kinetic properties of the studied enzymes with the 
      recombinant Arabidopsis SGATs previously obtained revealed substantial differences. 
      The ratio of the velocity of the transamination reaction with L-alanine and 
      glyoxylate as substrates versus that with L-serine and glyoxylate was 1:1.8 for the 
      native enzyme, whereas it was 1:7 for the recombinant SGAT. Native SGAT showed a 
      much lower Km value for L-alanine compared to the recombinant enzyme.

TI  - Magnesium dependence of the measured equilibrium constants of aminoacyl-tRNA 
      synthetases.
PG  - 29-35
AB  - The apparent equilibrium constants (K') for six reactions catalyzed by 
      aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases from Escherichia coli were measured, the equations for 
      the magnesium dependence of the equilibrium constants were derived, and best-fit 
      analyses between the measured and calculated values were used. The K' values at 1 mM 
      Mg(2+) ranged from 0.49 to 1.13. The apparent equilibrium constants increased with 
      increasing Mg(2+) concentrations. The values were 2-3 times higher at 20 mM Mg(2+) 
      than at 1 mM Mg(2+), and the dependence was similar in the class I and class II 
      synthetases. The main reason for the Mg(2+) dependence is the existence of PP(i) as 
      two magnesium complexes, but only one of them is the real product. AMP exists either 
      as free AMP or as MgAMP, and therefore also has some effect on the measured 
      equilibrium constant. However, these dependences alone cannot explain the measured 
      results. The measured dependence of the K' on the Mg(2+) concentration is weaker 
      than that caused by PP(i) and AMP. Different bindings of the Mg(2+) ions to the 
      substrate tRNA and product aminoacyl-tRNA can explain this observation. The best-fit 
      analysis suggests that tRNA reacts as a magnesium complex in the forward 
      aminoacylation direction but this given Mg(2+) ion is not bound to aminoacyl-tRNA at 
      the start of the reverse reaction. Thus Mg(2+) ions seem to have an active catalytic 
      role, not only in the activation of the amino acid, but in the posttransfer steps of 
      the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase reaction, too.

TI  - Enzymatic characterization of 5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate isomerase from Bacillus 
      subtilis.
PG  - 2021-8
AB  - The product of the mtnA gene of Bacillus subtilis catalyzes the isomerization of 
      5-methylthioribose 1-phosphate (MTR-1-P) to 5-methylthioribulose 1-phosphate 
      (MTRu-1-P). The catalysis of MtnA is a novel isomerization of an aldose phosphate 
      harboring a phosphate group on the hemiacetal group. This enzyme is distributed 
      widely among bacteria through higher eukaryotes. The isomerase reaction analyzed 
      using the recombinant B. subtilis enzyme showed a Michaelis constant for MTR-1-P of 
      138 microM, and showed that the maximum velocity of the reaction was 20.4 micromol 
      min(-1) (mg protein)(-1). The optimum reaction temperature and reaction pH were 35 
      degrees C and 8.1. The activation energy of the reaction was calculated to be 68.7 
      kJ mol(-1). The enzyme, with a molecular mass of 76 kDa, was composed of two 
      subunits. The equilibrium constant in the reversible isomerase reaction 
      [MTRu-1-P]/[MTR-1-P] was 6. We discuss the possible reaction mechanism.

TI  - Unusual mechanism for an aminomutase rearrangement: retention of configuration at 
      the migration termini.
PG  - 9785-94
AB  - The phenylalanine aminomutase from Taxus catalyzes the vicinal exchange of the amino 
      group and the pro-3S hydrogen of (2S)-alpha-phenylalanine to make 
      (3R)-beta-phenylalanine. While the migration of the amino group from C2 of the 
      substrate to C3 of the product is already known to proceed intramolecularly with 
      retention of configuration, the stereochemistry of the hydrogen transfer remained 
      unknown, until now. The chemical shifts of the prochiral hydrogens of authentic 
      (3R)-beta-phenylalanine were established by 1H NMR, and the configuration of each 
      hydrogen was assigned by 2H NMR analysis of a racemic mixture of [2,3-2H2]-(2S,3R)- 
      and (2R,3S)-beta-phenylalanines synthesized via syn addition of deuterium gas with 
      palladium catalyst to stereospecifically reduce the double bond of an N-acetyl 
      enamine. After the aminomutase was incubated with 
      [3,3-2H2]-(2S)-alpha-phenylalanine, the derived deuterium-labeled 
      beta-diastereoisomer product, derivatized as the N-acetyl methyl ester, was analyzed 
      by 2H NMR, which revealed that the mutase shuttles the pro-3S hydrogen to C2 of the 
      beta-isomer product (designated 2S,3R) with retention of configuration. Retention of 
      configuration at both reaction termini is unique among all aminomutase mechanisms 
      examined so far. Furthermore, the dynamics of the Cbeta-H bond of the substrate were 
      measured in a competitive experiment with deuterium-labeled substrate to calculate a 
      primary kinetic isotope effect on Vmax/KM of 2.0 +/- 0.2, indicating that C-H bond 
      cleavage is likely rate limiting. Isotope exchange data indicate that the migratory 
      deuterium of [2H8]-(2S)-alpha-phenylalanine, at saturation, dynamically exchanges up 
      to 75%, with protons from the solvent during the reaction after the first 10% of 
      product is formed. The calculated equilibrium constant of 1.1 indicates that the 
      beta-isomer was slightly favored relative to the alpha-isomer at 30 degrees C.

TI  - Modeling of urea degradation in white and rosé wines by acid urease.
PG  - 2590-6
AB  - The specific activity of a whole cell acid urease preparation was tested in five 
      wines manufactured in the Apulia region of Italy in the 2003 vintage at both short 
      and long treatment times, thus confirming the validity of the pseudo-first-order 
      kinetic model to describe urea removal in real wines. The ratio between the 
      experimental pseudo-first-order kinetic rate constant (kIe) for any real wine tested 
      and that (kI) referred to a model wine solution having the same composition and pH 
      reduced from about 0.21 to 0.02 as the overall content of phenolic compounds (P) 
      increased from 109 to 853 g m-3 of gallic acid equivalent (GAE). The specific 
      inhibitory effect of such compounds was explained by accounting for the equilibrium 
      constant (KP) of the reaction of polyphenols with acid urease, which was found to be 
      about 21 g of GAE m-3 for the real wines tested, whereas it ranged from about 16 to 
      45 g of GAE m-3 when the model wine solution was enriched with tannins extracted 
      from grape seeds or skins, respectively. A sequential experimental procedure 
      consisting of accelerated acid urease tests at high doses of enzyme followed by 
      accelerated ethyl carbamate tests on the resulting acid urease treated wine was 
      recommended to assess preliminarily the technoeconomic feasibility of the acid 
      urease hydrolytic process for the wine of concern. KEYWORDS: Acid urease; real and 
      model wines; phenolics; pseudo-first-order kinetic rate constant; inhibitory effect;

TI  - Basis for the equilibrium constant in the interconversion of l-lysine and 
      l-beta-lysine by lysine 2,3-aminomutase.
PG  - 297-302
AB  - l-beta-lysine and beta-glutamate are produced by the actions of lysine 
      2,3-aminomutase and glutamate 2,3-aminomutase, respectively. The pK(a) values have 
      been titrimetrically measured and are for l-beta-lysine: pK(1)=3.25 (carboxyl), 
      pK(2)=9.30 (beta-aminium), and pK(3)=10.5 (epsilon-aminium). For beta-glutamate the 
      values are pK(1)=3.13 (carboxyl), pK(2)=3.73 (carboxyl), and pK(3)=10.1 
      (beta-aminium). The equilibrium constants for reactions of 2,3-aminomutases favor 
      the beta-isomers. The pH and temperature dependencies of K(eq) have been measured 
      for the reaction of lysine 2,3-aminomutase to determine the basis for preferential 
      formation of beta-lysine. The value of K(eq) (8.5 at 37 degrees C) is independent of 
      pH between pH 6 and pH 11; ruling out differences in pK-values as the basis for the 
      equilibrium constant. The K(eq)-value is temperature-dependent and ranges from 10.9 
      at 4 degrees C to 6.8 at 65 degrees C. The linear van't Hoff plot shows the reaction 
      to be enthalpy-driven, with DeltaH degrees =-1.4 kcal mol(-1) and DeltaS degrees 
      =-0.25 cal deg(-1) mol(-1). Exothermicity is attributed to the greater strength of 
      the bond C(beta)-N(beta) in l-beta-lysine than C(alpha)-N(alpha) in l-lysine, and 
      this should hold for other amino acids.

TI  - Tautomerism of histidine 64 associated with proton transfer in catalysis of carbonic 
      anhydrase.

AB  - The imidazole (15)N signals of histidine 64 (His(64)), involved in the catalytic 
      function of human carbonic anhydrase II (hCAII), were assigned unambiguously. This 
      was accomplished by incorporating the labeled histidine as probes for solution NMR 
      analysis, with (15)N at ring-N(delta1) and N(epsilon2), (13)Cat ring-Cepsilon1, 
      (13)C and (15)N at all carbon and nitrogen, or (15)N at the amide nitrogen and the 
      labeled glycine with (13)C at the carbonyl carbon. Using the pH dependence of 
      ring-(15)N signals and a comparison between experimental and simulated curves, we 
      determined that the tautomeric equilibrium constant (K(T)) of His(64) is 1.0, which 
      differs from that of other histidine residues. This unique value characterizes the 
      imidazole nitrogen atoms of His(64) as both a general acid (a) and base (b): its 
      epsilon2-nitrogen as (a) releases one proton into the bulk, whereas its 
      delta1-nitrogen as (b) extracts another proton from a water molecule within the 
      water bridge coupling to the zinc-bound water inside the cave. This accelerates the 
      generation of zinc-bound hydroxide to react with the carbon dioxide. Releasing the 
      productive bicarbonate ion from the inside separates the water bridge pathway, in 
      which the next water molecules move into beside zinc ion. A new water molecule is 
      supplied from the bulk to near the delta1-nitrogen of His(64). These reconstitute 
      the water bridge. Based on these features, we suggest here a catalytic mechanism for 
      hCAII: the tautomerization of His(64) can mediate the transfers of both protons and 
      water molecules at a neutral pH with high efficiency, requiring no time- or 
      energy-consuming processes.

TI  - The catalytic mode of cysteine proteinases of papain (C1) family.
PG  - 1931-9
AB  - The Proton Inventory (PI) method has been applied in the hydrolysis of synthetic 
      substrates by papain, chymopapain and stem bromelain, comparing also their 
      corresponding pH-(k(cat)/K(m)) profiles, and it was found: (a) k(cat)/K(m)=k(1), and 
      thus K(S)=k(2)/k(1) is a dynamic equilibrium constant, (b) bowed-downward PI for 
      k(cat)/K(m) exhibiting large inverse SIE, and (c) linear PI exhibiting large normal 
      SIE for K(S), k(2) and k(3). A novel finding of this work is that the association of 
      substrates onto all three studied cysteine proteinases proceeds via a stepwise 
      pathway, in contrast to purely concerted pathways found previously for both 
      acylation and deacylation. A hydrogen bond, which seems more likely to be developed 
      across a pK(a)-value close to 4.00, connecting [see text] (papain/chymopapain or 
      bromelain numbering), constitutes another novelty of this work.
