AB  - Plastics are globally used for a variety of benefits. As a consequence of poor 
      recycling or reuse, improperly disposed plastic waste accumulates in terrestrial and 
      aquatic ecosystems to a considerable extent. Large plastic waste items become 
      fragmented to small particles through mechanical and (photo)chemical processes. 
      Particles with sizes ranging from millimeter (microplastics, <5 mm) to nanometer 
      (nanoplastics, NP, <100 nm) are apparently persistent and have adverse effects on 
      ecosystems and human health. Current research therefore focuses on whether and to 
      what extent microorganisms or enzymes can degrade these NP. In this study, we 
      addressed the question of what information isothermal titration calorimetry, which 
      tracks the heat of reaction of the chain scission of a polyester, can provide about 
      the kinetics and completeness of the degradation process. The majority of the heat 
      represents the cleavage energy of the ester bonds in polymer backbones providing 
      real-time kinetic information. Calorimetry operates even in complex matrices. Using 
      the example of the cutinase-catalyzed degradation of polyethylene terephthalate 
      (PET) nanoparticles, we found that calorimetry (isothermal titration 
      calorimetry-ITC) in combination with thermokinetic models is excellently suited for 
      an in-depth analysis of the degradation processes of NP. For instance, we can 
      separately quantify i) the enthalpy of surface adsorption ∆(Ads)H = 
      129 ± 2 kJ mol(-1), ii) the enthalpy of the cleavage of the ester bonds ∆(EB)H = 
      -58 ± 1.9 kJ mol(-1) and the apparent equilibrium constant of the enzyme substrate 
      complex K = 0.046 ± 0.015 g L(-1). It could be determined that the heat production 
      of PET NP degradation depends to 95% on the reaction heat and only to 5% on the 
      adsorption heat. The fact that the percentage of cleaved ester bonds 
      (η = 12.9 ± 2.4%) is quantifiable with the new method is of particular practical 
      importance. The new method promises a quantification of enzymatic and microbial 
      adsorption to NP and their degradation in mimicked real-world aquatic conditions.

AB  - In this work, cystine-glucose Maillard conjugates were composited with Cu(1.8)S 
      microspheres (Cu(1.8)S-cgmc) to achieve higher sensitivity for the colorimetric 
      analysis. Enhanced peroxidase-like activity was obtained in Cu(1.8)S-cgmc with a 
      carbon elemental ratio of 1.83% compared to bare Cu(1.8)S. The catalytic activity of 
      Cu(1.8)S-cgmc followed Michaelis-Menten kinetic behavior. The Michaelis-Menten 
      constants of Cu(1.8)S-cgmc on the substrate was over 2-fold lower than that of the 
      bare Cu(1.8)S, indicating the higher affinity of Cu(1.8)S-cgmc. The adsorption 
      equilibrium constant of Cu(1.8)S-cgmc on the substrate was 9.89-fold higher than 
      that of bare Cu(1.8)S based on thermodynamic investigations. The conjugated 
      structure and carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino groups on Cu(1.8)S-cgmc improved its 
      hydrophilicity and adsorption on the substrate. The affinity-improved Cu(1.8)S-cgmc 
      was applied as a peroxidase mimic in colorimetric detection with promoted 
      sensitivity. Compared to bare Cu(1.8)S, Cu(1.8)S-cgmc had a 25.5-fold and 19.8-fold 
      lower LOD for H(2)O(2) and glutathione, respectively. The Cu(1.8)S-cgmc-based 
      colorimetric method showed excellent sensitivity and accuracy in practical 
      colorimetric detection.

AB  - Immunoassays are nowadays being employed for rapid contaminant analysis in clinical, 
      environmental, and agrochemical samples. A thorough characterization of the 
      antibody‒antigen interaction can bring light to the immunoreagent selection process 
      in order to develop sensitive and robust tests. Thus, determination of equilibrium 
      and reaction rate constants is usually recommendable. However, this can be quite 
      tricky for low molecular weight compounds, and competitive strategies are commonly 
      followed to estimate apparent affinity values. In the present study, a collection of 
      monoclonal antibodies to penthiopyrad was raised for the first time, and apparent 
      equilibrium constants were assessed by the Langmuir model using three different 
      competitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay formats. The obtained K(D) values from 
      antibody-coated assays were quite close to the corresponding K(D) values calculated 
      from surface plasmon resonance (SPR) evaluation. These studies were employed to 
      select a pair of immunoreagents for immunoassay development. The K(D) value for 
      penthiopyrad of the selected antibody obtained by SPR was 0.28 nM. The optimized 
      direct assay showed an IC(50) value for penthiopyrad of 0.42 nM (0.15 ng mL(-1)) in 
      buffer. The limit of quantification for grape, must, and wine samples was 
      10 ng mL(-1). An excellent correlation was found when immunochemical results were 
      compared with those from LC-MS/MS. As an application case, it was determined that 
      58% of penthiopyrad was still found in wine after fermentation.

AB  - Eukaryotic cells exploit dynamic and compartmentalized ionic strength to impact a 
      myriad of biological functions such as enzyme activities, protein-protein 
      interactions, and catalytic functions. Herein, we investigated the fluorescence 
      depolarization dynamics of recently developed ionic strength biosensors 
      (mCerulean3-linker-mCitrine) in Hofmeister salt (KCl, NaCl, NaI, and Na(2)SO(4)) 
      solutions. The mCerulean3-mCitrine acts as a Förster resonance energy transfer 
      (FRET) pair, tethered together by two oppositely charged α-helices in the linker 
      region. We developed a time-resolved fluorescence depolarization anisotropy approach 
      for FRET analyses, in which the donor (mCerulean3) is excited by 425-nm laser 
      pulses, followed by fluorescence depolarization analysis of the acceptor (mCitrine) 
      in KE (lysine-glutamate), arginine-aspartate, and arginine-glutamate ionic strength 
      sensors with variable amino acid sequences. Similar experiments were carried out on 
      the cleaved sensors as well as an E6G2 construct, which has neutral α-helices in the 
      linker region, as a control. Our results show distinct dynamics of the intact and 
      cleaved sensors. Importantly, the FRET efficiency decreases and the donor-acceptor 
      distance increases as the environmental ionic strength increases. Our chemical 
      equilibrium analyses of the collapsed-to-stretched conformational state transition 
      of KE reveal that the corresponding equilibrium constant and standard Gibbs free 
      energy changes are ionic strength dependent. We also tested the existing theoretical 
      models for FRET analyses using steady-state anisotropy, which reveal that the angle 
      between the dipole moments of the donor and acceptor in the KE sensor are sensitive 
      to the ionic strength. These results help establish the time-resolved depolarization 
      dynamics of these genetically encoded donor-acceptor pairs as a quantitative means 
      for FRET analysis, which complement traditional methods such as time-resolved 
      fluorescence for future in vivo studies.

TI  - Magnesium Signaling in Plants.
LID - 10.3390/ijms22031159 [doi]
LID - 1159
AB  - Free magnesium (Mg(2+)) is a signal of the adenylate (ATP+ADP+AMP) status in the 
      cells. It results from the equilibrium of adenylate kinase (AK), which uses 
      Mg-chelated and Mg-free adenylates as substrates in both directions of its reaction. 
      The AK-mediated primary control of intracellular [Mg(2+)] is finely interwoven with 
      the operation of membrane-bound adenylate- and Mg(2+)-translocators, which in a 
      given compartment control the supply of free adenylates and Mg(2+) for the 
      AK-mediated equilibration. As a result, [Mg(2+)] itself varies both between and 
      within the compartments, depending on their energetic status and environmental 
      clues. Other key nucleotide-utilizing/producing enzymes (e.g., nucleoside 
      diphosphate kinase) may also be involved in fine-tuning of the intracellular 
      [Mg(2+)]. Changes in [Mg(2+)] regulate activities of myriads of 
      Mg-utilizing/requiring enzymes, affecting metabolism under both normal and stress 
      conditions, and impacting photosynthetic performance, respiration, phloem loading 
      and other processes. In compartments controlled by AK equilibrium (cytosol, 
      chloroplasts, mitochondria, nucleus), the intracellular [Mg(2+)] can be calculated 
      from total adenylate contents, based on the dependence of the apparent equilibrium 
      constant of AK on [Mg(2+)]. Magnesium signaling, reflecting cellular adenylate 
      status, is likely widespread in all eukaryotic and prokaryotic organisms, due simply 
      to the omnipresent nature of AK and to its involvement in adenylate equilibration.

AB  - TAP38/STN7-dependent (de)phosphorylation of light-harvesting complex II (LHCII) 
      regulates the relative excitation rates of photosystems I and II (PSI, PSII) (state 
      transitions) and the size of the thylakoid grana stacks (dynamic thylakoid 
      stacking). Yet, it remains unclear how changing grana size benefits photosynthesis 
      and whether these two regulatory mechanisms function independently. Here, by 
      comparing Arabidopsis wild-type, stn7 and tap38 plants with the psal mutant, which 
      undergoes dynamic thylakoid stacking but lacks state transitions, we explain their 
      distinct roles. Under low light, smaller grana increase the rate of PSI reduction 
      and photosynthesis by reducing the diffusion distance for plastoquinol; however, 
      this beneficial effect is only apparent when PSI/PSII excitation balance is 
      maintained by state transitions or far-red light. Under high light, the larger grana 
      slow plastoquinol diffusion and lower the equilibrium constant between plastocyanin 
      and PSI, maximizing photosynthesis by avoiding PSI photoinhibition. Loss of state 
      transitions in low light or maintenance of smaller grana in high light also both 
      bring about a decrease in cyclic electron transfer and over-reduction of the PSI 
      acceptor side. These results demonstrate that state transitions and dynamic 
      thylakoid stacking work synergistically to regulate photosynthesis in variable 
      light.

AB  - The mechanism of nanoparticles (NPs) synthesis is a crucial prerequisite for the 
      engineering of desirable material properties and is elusive due to the difficulty of 
      studying the synthesis path and also due to lack of published work. The present 
      study moves beyond the current conventional study of characterisation of NPs 
      synthesis. It focuses on study of classical kinetics of metal NP using silver as a 
      model metal to perform the required experiments, it aimed at understanding the 
      crystallisation process which is the major root for the synthesis of metal NP. The 
      authors have chosen biological approach to explain the process of synthesis of metal 
      NP using inductively coupled plasma - optical emission spectroscopy that directly 
      analyses the concentration of metal NPs. Alpha-amylase solution, when incubated with 
      silver nitrate solution, turned brown at a specific concentration of enzyme and 
      substrate, which shows the formation of silver NPs. Inductively coupled plasma data 
      and dynamic light scattering spectra were studied to understand the kinetics and the 
      kinetics model was obtained. The enthalpy (ΔH*), activation energy (ΔE*), and 
      equilibrium constant (K) were calculated for understanding the thermodynamics of the 
      reaction. The process of NP synthesis is dependent on the kinetics of the reaction, 
      and other process parameters limit the thermodynamics of the process.

AB  - Different methodologies for determining the dissociation equilibrium constant (K(i)) 
      of protein tight binding inhibitors are frequently found in the scientific 
      literature. Taking into account that the K(i) value is the main parameter 
      characterizing the inhibition strength, its determination often represents the first 
      step during the characterization of a potential drug. The purpose of this review is 
      to summarize the current information related to tight binding inhibitors K(i) values 
      determination and discuss about the importance of different factors as the enzyme 
      concentration, the inhibitor concentration dilution series, the enzyme-inhibitor 
      incubation time and the dose-response data mathematical fitting. For this aim, the 
      bi-functional SmCI protease inhibitor is used as a tool for exemplifying the 
      experimental and mathematical steps performed during tight binding inhibitors K(i) 
      values determination. In addition, the natural and the different recombinant forms 
      of SmCI were used to go deeply into the comparison of some mathematic approaches 
      that are frequently used in the literature. Finally, other biochemical techniques 
      that could be potentially used for tight binding inhibitors K(i) values 
      determination are also commented.

TI  - Impact of Cholesterol Concentration and Lipid Phase on Structure and Fluctuation of 
      Amyloid Precursor Protein.
PG  - 10173-10185
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.0c07615 [doi]
AB  - Elevated levels of cellular cholesterol have been identified as one factor 
      contributing to the onset of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specific interaction between 
      cholesterol and the amyloid precursor protein (APP), investigated via NMR 
      experiments and computational studies, has been proposed to play a critical role in 
      the processing of APP by secretases and the biogenesis of amyloid-β (Aβ) protein. We 
      present all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of the 40-residue congener of the 
      C-terminal domain of APP, C99(16-55) (C99), in cholesterol-enriched DMPC lipid 
      bilayers. We investigated the effect of cholesterol concentration on the 
      conformational ensemble of wild-type C99 and C99-cholesterol associations at the low 
      pH of endosomal environments, at which residues E22 and D23 are neutral. C99 was 
      also characterized in liquid ordered domains for Dutch (E22Q) and Iowa (D23N) 
      Familial AD mutants at low pH and for the wild-type sequence using protonation 
      states characteristic of neutral pH. Our results reproduce the equilibrium constant 
      of past NMR characterizations of the C99-cholesterol interaction but are not 
      consistent with the C99-cholesterol binding hypothesis. We find that the lifetimes 
      of both DMPC and cholesterol complexed with C99 display a power-law distribution of 
      residence lifetimes. Longer-lived C99-DMPC and C99-cholesterol complexes are 
      primarily stabilized by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds of lysine amines to 
      phosphate and hydroxyl groups. Nevertheless, specific interfaces for C99-cholesterol 
      association which are not present for DMPC can be identified. Changes to 
      C99-cholesterol interfaces are found to depend on C99 tilt angle and orientation of 
      the juxtamembrane domain of C99 containing residues E22 and D23. These observations 
      support a more nuanced view of the C99-cholesterol interaction than has previously 
      been suggested. We propose that cholesterol modulates the conformation and activity 
      of C99 and other small transmembrane proteins indirectly through induction of the 
      liquid ordered phase and directly through hydrogen bonding. This suggests a critical 
      role for membrane heterogeneity introduced by cholesterol in modulating the 
      structural ensemble of C99 and the production of Aβ.

TI  - Words of advice: teaching enzyme kinetics.
PG  - 2068-2083
LID - 10.1111/febs.15537 [doi]
AB  - Enzymology is concerned with the study of enzyme structure, function, regulation and 
      kinetics. It is an interdisciplinary subject that can be treated as an exclusive 
      sphere of exhaustive inquiry within mathematical, physico-chemical and biological 
      sciences. Hence, teaching of enzymology, in general, and enzyme kinetics, in 
      particular, should be undertaken in an interdisciplinary manner for a holistic 
      appreciation of this subject. Further, analogous examples from everyday life should 
      form an integral component of the teaching for an intuitive grasp of the subject 
      matter. Furthermore, simulation-based appreciation of enzyme kinetics should be 
      preferred over simplifying assumptions and approximations of traditional enzyme 
      kinetics teaching. In this Words of Advice, I outline the domain depth of enzymology 
      across the various disciplines and provide initial ideas on how appropriate 
      analogies can provide firm insights into the subject. Further, I demonstrate how an 
      intuitive feel for the subject can help not only in grasping abstract concepts but 
      also extending it in experimental design and subsequent interpretation. Use of 
      simulations in grasping complex concepts is also advocated given the advantages this 
      medium offers over traditional approaches involving images and molecular models. 
      Furthermore, I discuss the merits of incorporating the historical backdrop of major 
      discoveries in enzymological teaching. We, at AstraZeneca, have experimented with 
      this approach with the desired outcome of generating interest in the subject from 
      people practising diverse disciplines.

TI  - Unique Enzyme Activity of Peroxidase on a Clay Nanosheet.
PG  - 8384-8388
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.0c00607 [doi]
AB  - The adsorption behavior and enzyme activity of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) was 
      examined on a synthetic clay nanosheet, whose surface is flat at the atomic level 
      and is negatively charged. The results showed that HRP is adsorbed effectively 
      (adsorption equilibrium constant, K = 1.61 × 10(7) L mol(-1)) and that the structure 
      of HRP was altered on the clay surface. The enzyme activity of HRP on the clay 
      surface was evaluated by using H(2)O(2) and tert-BuOOH as a substrate. As a result, 
      HRP on the clay surface was able to work for tert-BuOOH, while HRP in solution did 
      not show any activity. In addition, HRP on SSA showed reactivity even under the 
      high-temperature conditions. These results indicate that the clay nanosheet can be a 
      unique modifier for enzyme activity of HRP.

TI  - Proof of concept for poor inhibitor binding and efficient formation of covalent 
      adducts of KRAS(G12C) and ARS compounds.
PG  - 3069-3081

AB  - The use of selective covalent inhibitors with low binding affinity and high 
      reactivity with the target enzyme is a promising way to solve a long-standing 
      problem of the "undruggable" RAS-like proteins. Specifically, compounds of the ARS 
      family that prevent the activation of the GDP-bound G12C mutant of Kirsten RAS 
      (KRAS) are in the focus of recent experimental research. We report the first 
      computational characterization of the entire reaction mechanism of the covalent 
      binding of ARS-853 to the KRASG12C·GDP complex. The application of molecular 
      dynamics, molecular docking and quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics approaches 
      allowed us to model the inhibitor binding to the protein and the chemical reaction 
      of ARS-853 with Cys12 in the enzyme binding site. We estimated a full set of kinetic 
      constants and carried out numerical kinetic analysis of the process. Thus, we were 
      able to compare directly the physicochemical parameters of the reaction obtained in 
      silico and the macroscopic parameters observed in experimental studies. From our 
      computational results, we explain the observed unusual dependence of the rate 
      constant of covalent complex formation, kobs, on the ARS concentration. The latter 
      depends both on the non-covalent binding step with the equilibrium constant, Ki, and 
      on the rate constant of covalent adduct formation, kinact. The calculated ratio 
      kinact/Ki = 213 M-1 s-1 reproduces the corresponding experimental value of 250 ± 30 
      M-1 s-1 for the interaction of ARS-853 with KRASG12C. Electron density analysis in 
      the reactive region demonstrates that covalent bond formation occurs efficiently 
      according to the Michael addition mechanism, which assumes the activation of the 
      C[double bond, length as m-dash]C bond of ARS-853 by a water molecule and Lys16 in 
      the binding site of KRASG12C. We also refine the kinact and Ki constants of the 
      ARS-107 compound, which shares common features with ARS-853, and show that the 
      decrease in the kinact/Ki ratio in the case of ARS-107 is explained by changes in 
      both Ki and kinact constants.

AB  - Measurements of biomolecular interactions are crucial to understand the mechanisms 
      of the biological processes they facilitate. Bulk-based methods such as ITC and SPR 
      provide important information on binding affinities, stoichiometry, and kinetics of 
      interactions. However, the ensemble averaging approaches are not able to probe the 
      intrinsic heterogeneity often displayed by biological systems. Interactions that 
      involve cooperativity or result in the formation of multicomponent complexes pose 
      additional experimental challenges. Single-molecule techniques have previously been 
      applied to solve these problems. However, single-molecule experiments are often 
      technically demanding and require labeling or immobilization of the molecules under 
      study. A recently developed single-molecule method, mass photometry (MP), overcomes 
      these limitations. Here we applied MP to measure the affinities of biomolecular 
      interactions. We have demonstrated how MP allows the user to study multivalent 
      complexes and quantify the affinities of different binding sites in a single 
      measurement. Results obtained from this single-molecule technique have been 
      validated by ITC and BLI. The quality and information content of the MP data, 
      combined with simple and fast measurements and low sample consumption makes MP a new 
      preferred method for measuring strong protein-protein interactions.

TI  - Dimerization of LOV domains of Rhodobacter sphaeroides (RsLOV) studied with FRET and 
      stopped-flow experiments.
PG  - 159-170
LID - 10.1039/c9pp00424f [doi]
AB  - The bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides has a short LOV (light-oxygen-voltage) domain, 
      which is not connected to an effector domain but has an α-helix extension at the 
      N-terminus as well as a helix-turn-helix (HTH) motiv at the C-terminus. These 
      extensions offer possibilities for interactions with effector enzymes or DNA. 
      Whereas many LOV domains show a tendency to form dimers in the light state, RsLOV is 
      unique in that it is a dimer in the dark state but dissociates into monomers after 
      blue-light excitation. We studied the kinetics of this dimerization process by a 
      combination of FRET spectroscopy and stopped-flow experiments with a time resolution 
      of ≈10 ms. Although excitation of the flavin chromophore in dye-labeled LOV domains 
      leads to considerable FRET from flavin to the dye, the typical adduct formation 
      between flavin and a nearby cysteine still occurs with considerable yield. We obtain 
      a rate constant for LOV-LOV dimerization in the range (0.8-1.8) × 105 M-1 s-1, and 
      an equilibrium constant of the dark-state dimer in the range (3.0-7.0) × 10-6 M. 
      Dissociation of the dimers in the light state and reforming of dimers after return 
      to the dark state was monitored using an anti-FRET effect caused by excitonic 
      interaction between dye labels on different monomers. Reforming of the dark state 
      dimers is slower than recovery of the flavin-cysteinyl adduct, indicating that 
      light-induced conformational changes in the LOV domain persist for much longer time 
      than the adduct lifetime.

TI  - Insight into the Synergistic Effect of Adsorption-Photocatalysis for the Removal of 
      Organic Dye Pollutants by Cr-Doped ZnO.
PG  - 520-533
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b02879 [doi]
AB  - The adsorption of dye molecules is an important process for the photodegradation 
      removal of dye pollutants. In this work, a semiconductor photocatalyst of Cr-doped 
      ZnO nanorods (Cr-ZnO NRs) was synthesized, and its adsorption-photocatalysis synergy 
      (APS) effect was investigated for anionic methyl orange (MO(-)) and cationic 
      methylene blue (MB(+)). The detailed thermodynamic information (including adsorption 
      maximum capacity q(max), adsorption equilibrium constant K(ads) and adsorption 
      efficiency AE %) and dynamic information (including adsorption rate constant k(a), 
      degradation rate constant k(d) and degradation efficiency DE %) were obtained to 
      evaluate the different reaction performances for MO(-) and MB(+). With q(max(MB(+))) 
      = 40.59 mg g(-1) > q(max(MO(-))) = 15.95 mg g(-1), k(a(MB(+))) = 20.61 min(-1) > 
      k(a(MO(-))) = 4.62 min(-1), and AE((MB(+))) = 40% > AE((MO(-))) = 9%, Cr-ZnO NRs 
      showed much superior adsorption performance for MB(+) than MO(-). With k(d (MB(+))) 
      = 0.0430 min(-1) > k(d (MO(-))) = 0.0014 min(-1) and DE((MB(+))) = 98% > AE((MO(-))) 
      = 20%, Cr-ZnO NRs also showed much superior photodegradation performance for MB(+) 
      than MO(-). The APS mechanism of Cr-ZnO NRs is revealed to be multiple π-π 
      interactions and stronger electrostatic attractions dominant for enhanced adsorption 
      of MB(+) and higher AE and more photocatalytic active species dominant for enhanced 
      photodegradation of MB(+). The APS was furthermore characterized and verified by 
      zeta potential analysis, Fourier transform infrared investigation, and fluorescence 
      imaging. The results indicate that Cr-ZnO NRs are promising adsorbent and 
      photocatalyst candidates favorable for positive MB(+) than negative MO(-). Such an 
      APS investigation can effectively help to improve the photodegradation treatment 
      performance of photocatalysts for dye pollutant removal.

TI  - The apparent deglycase activity of DJ-1 results from the conversion of free 
      methylglyoxal present in fast equilibrium with hemithioacetals and hemiaminals.

AB  - Loss-of-function mutations in the gene encoding human protein DJ-1 cause early onset 
      of Parkinson's disease, suggesting that DJ-1 protects dopaminergic neurons. The 
      molecular mechanisms underlying this neuroprotection are unclear; however, DJ-1 has 
      been suggested to be a GSH-independent glyoxalase that detoxifies methylglyoxal 
      (MGO) by converting it into lactate. It has also been suggested that DJ-1 serves as 
      a deglycase that catalyzes hydrolysis of hemithioacetals and hemiaminals formed by 
      reactions of MGO with the thiol and amino groups of proteins. In this report, we 
      demonstrate that the equilibrium constant of reaction of MGO with thiols is ∼500 
      m(-1) at 37 °C and that the half-life of the resulting hemithioacetal is only 12 s. 
      These thermodynamic parameters would dictate that a significant fraction of free MGO 
      will be present in a fast equilibrium with hemithioacetals in solution. We found 
      that removal of free MGO by DJ-1's glyoxalase activity forces immediate spontaneous 
      decomposition of hemithioacetals due to the shift in equilibrium position. This 
      spontaneous decomposition of hemithioacetals could be mistaken for deglycase 
      activity of DJ-1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that higher initial concentrations of 
      hemithioacetals are associated with lower rates of DJ-1-mediated conversion of MGO, 
      ruling out the possibility that hemithioacetals are DJ-1 substrates. Experiments 
      with CRISPR/Cas-generated DJ-1-knockout HEK293 cells revealed that DJ-1 does not 
      protect against acute MGO toxicity or carboxymethylation of lysine residues in 
      cells. Combined, our results suggest that DJ-1 does not possess protein deglycase 
      activity.

AB  - In this study, an accurately and digitally regulated allosteric nanoswitch based on 
      the conformational control of two DNA hairpins was developed. By switching between 
      UV irradiation and blue light conditions, the second molecular beacon (H#2) would 
      bind/separate with a repression sequence (RES) via the introduced PTG molecules (a 
      photosensitive azobenzene derivative), resulting in the target aptamer sequence in 
      the first molecular beacon (H#1) not being able/being able to hold the stem-loop 
      configuration, hence losing/regaining the ability to bind with the target. 
      Importantly, we successfully monitor conformation changes of the nanoswitch by an 
      elegant mathematical model for connecting K(i) (the dissociation constant between 
      RES and H#2) with K(d) (the overall equilibrium constant of the nanoswitch binding 
      the target), hence realizing "observing" DNA structure across dimensions from 
      "structural visualization" to digitization and, accurately, digitally regulating DNA 
      structure from digitization to "structural visualization".

TI  - Insight into the Adsorption-Interaction Mechanism of Cr(VI) at the Silica Adsorbent 
      Surface by Evanescent Wave Measurement.
PG  - 14414-14427
LID - 10.1021/acs.langmuir.9b01556 [doi]
AB  - The investigation of adsorption performance at the adsorbent surface can help to 
      reveal the treatment mechanism and improve the treatment efficiency of adsorption 
      technology for heavy metal ions (HMIs). This work developed a methodology to 
      investigate the adsorption behavior of HMI Cr(VI) at the silica surface by confined 
      near-field evanescent wave (CNFEW) measurement. A silica optical fiber (SOF) was 
      used as the adsorption substrate and light waveguide element to integrate both 
      Cr(VI) adsorption and CNFEW production on its surface. According to the sensitive 
      CNFEW response, the adsorption behavior of Cr(VI) was in situ monitored and 
      real-time evaluated. The thermodynamic information of adsorption equilibrium 
      constant (K(ads)) and adsorption free energy (ΔG) and dynamic information of the 
      apparent adsorption rate (v(ads)) and adsorption time (t(ads)) were obtained through 
      Langmuir isotherm and kinetic fitting, respectively. Different reaction performances 
      between Cr(VI) and adsorption sites were successfully differentiated, evaluated, and 
      characterized. A site-decided-mechanism was therefore presented to describe the 
      surface interaction process for Cr(VI), which including fast adsorption on type I 
      Si-O(-) site through electrostatic attraction with [Formula: see text] and slow 
      adsorption on type II Si-OH site through coordinative interaction with 
      ΔG(SiOH-Cr(VI))(II) = -26.18 kJ mol(-1). The adsorption mechanism of Cr(VI) at the 
      SOF silica surface was furthermore verified by zeta potential analysis, Fourier 
      transform infrared investigation, and fluorescence imaging. Unlike conventional ex 
      situ or in bulk detection, the present CNFEW-based approach targets the "localized" 
      adsorption of Cr(VI) adsorbed to the solid adsorbent surface. Consequently, our work 
      favorably constructs a surface platform and provides new insights on understanding 
      the adsorption mechanism for HMIs.

AB  - Tyrosinase is a metalloenzyme involved in o-hydroxylation of monophenols and 
      oxidation of o-diphenols to o-quinones, with formation of brown or black pigments 
      (melanines). Tyrosinase inhibitors are of great interest in medicine and cosmetics 
      (skin whitening compounds), but also in food and beverage industry (antibrowning 
      agents). Here we report on the activity as mushroom tyrosinase inhibitors of a 
      series of hydroxyphenyl thiosemicarbazones (1-5): one of them revealed an inhibitory 
      activity stronger than kojic acid, used as reference. Enzymatic inhibition activity 
      was confirmed by colorimetric measurements on small wheels of Fuji apples treated 
      with the hydroxyphenyl thiosemicarbazones. The mechanism of action of compounds 1-5 
      was investigated by molecular modelling and by studying in solution their speciation 
      with Cu(II) ions, the ions in the active site of the enzyme. Finally, compounds 1-5 
      were tested on human fibroblasts: they are not cytotoxic and they do not activate 
      cells in a pro-inflammatory way.

TI  - Determination of the Equilibrium Constant and Rate Constant of 
      Protein-Oligonucleotide Complex Dissociation under the Conditions of Ideal-Filter 
      Capillary Electrophoresis.
PG  - 8532-8539
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.9b01801 [doi]
AB  - Ideal-filter capillary electrophoresis (IFCE) allows selection of protein binders 
      from oligonucleotide libraries in a single step of partitioning in which 
      protein-bound and unbound oligonucleotides move in the opposite directions. In IFCE, 
      the unbound oligonucleotide does not reach the detector, imposing a problem for 
      finding the equilibrium constant ( K(d)) and rate constant ( k(off)) of 
      protein-oligonucleotide complex dissociation. We report a double-passage approach 
      that allows finding K(d) and k(off) under the IFCE conditions, i.e. 
      near-physiological pH and ionic strength. First, a plug of the 
      protein-oligonucleotide equilibrium mixture passes to the detector in a 
      pressure-driven flow, allowing for both the complex and free oligonucleotide to be 
      detected as a single first peak. Second, the pressure is turned off and the voltage 
      is applied to reverse the migration of only the complex which is detected as the 
      second peak. The experiment is repeated with a lower voltage consequently resulting 
      in longer travel time of the complex to the detector, greater extent of complex 
      dissociation, and the decreased area of the second peak. Finally, the peak areas are 
      used to calculate the values of K(d) and k(off). Here we explain theoretical and 
      practical aspects of the double-passage approach, prove its validity quantitatively, 
      and, demonstrate its application to determine K(d) and k(off) for an affinity 
      complex between a protein and its DNA aptamer. The double-passage approach for 
      finding K(d) and k(off) of protein-oligonucleotide complexes under the IFCE 
      conditions is a perfect complement for IFCE-based selection of protein binders from 
      oligonucleotide libraries.

      separations. Experiments are performed at 19 °C, where almost all short RNAs 
      detected are intermediates in FL-RNA synthesis by productive complexes or 
      end-products in nonproductive (stalled) initiation complexes and not from abortive 
      initiation. Analysis of productive-initiation kinetic data yields composite 
      second-order rate constants for all steps of NTP binding and hybrid extension up to 
      the escape point (11-mer). The largest of these rate constants is for incorporation 
      of UTP into the dinucleotide pppApU in a step which does not involve DNA opening or 
      translocation. Subsequent steps, each of which begins with reversible translocation 
      and DNA opening, are slower with rate constants that vary more than 10-fold, 
      interpreted as effects of translocation stress on the translocation equilibrium 
      constant. Rate constants for synthesis of 4- and 5-mer, 7-mer to 9-mer, and 11-mer 
      are particularly small, indicating that RNAP-promoter interactions are disrupted in 
      these steps. These reductions in rate constants are consistent with the previously 
      determined ∼9 kcal cost of escape from λP(R). Structural modeling and previous 
      results indicate that the three groups of small rate constants correspond to 
      sequential disruption of in-cleft, -10, and -35 interactions. Parallels to escape by 
      T7 RNAP are discussed.

AB  - The pK(a) values for substrates acting as carbon acids (i.e., C-H deprotonation 
      reactions) in several enzyme active sites are presented. The information needed to 
      calculate them includes the pK(a) of the active site acid/base catalyst and the 
      equilibrium constant for the deprotonation step. Carbon acidity is obtained from the 
      relation pK(eq) = p Kar -p Kap = ΔpK(a) for a proton transfer reaction. Five 
      enzymatic free energy profiles (FEPs) were calculated to obtain the equilibrium 
      constants for proton transfer from carbon in the active site, and six additional 
      proton transfer equilibrium constants were extracted from data available in the 
      literature, allowing substrate C-H pK(a)s to be calculated for 11 enzymes. Active 
      site-bound substrate C-H pK(a) values range from 5.6 for ketosteroid isomerase to 16 
      for proline racemase. Compared to values in water, enzymes lower substrate C-H 
      pK(a)s by up to 23 units, corresponding to 31 kcal/mol of carbanion stabilization 
      energy. Calculation of Marcus intrinsic barriers (Δ G0‡ ) for pairs of 
      non-enzymatic/enzymatic reactions shows significant reductions in Δ G0‡ for 
      cofactor-independent enzymes, while pyridoxal phosphate dependent enzymes appear to 
      increase Δ G0‡ to a small extent as a consequence of carbanion resonance 
      stabilization. The large increases in carbon acidity found here are central to the 
      large rate enhancements observed in enzymes that catalyze carbon deprotonation.

AB  - Polyhydroxyalkanoates are gaining importance due to their biodegradable nature and 
      close analogy to plastics. Polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) is the most widely used 
      bioplastic from polyalkanoate family, which is produced by a legion of bacterial 
      species via phbCAB operon encoding β-ketothiolase (PhaA), NADPH-dependent 
      acetoacetyl-coenzyme A (acetoacetyl-CoA) reductase (PhaB) and polyhydroxyalkanoate 
      synthase (PhaC). Augmentation in the activity of these enzymes is promising for 
      increased PHB production which is achieved by enzyme engineering strategies 
      including non-structural and structural approaches. Our study is deployed on 
      directed evolution-based experimentally reported mutants of PhaB enzyme with 
      increased efficiency due to impact on critical structural factors. We have analyzed 
      and compared the native PhaB with two of its variants Q47L and T173S in complex with 
      their cofactor i.e. NADPH as well as the substrate i.e. acetoacetyl-CoA, via long 
      range molecular dynamics simulations. Interaction profile, MMPBSA, essential 
      dynamics, and free energy landscape analysis revealed that the enzyme efficiency is 
      critically affected by cofactor interactions. It was also observed that mutants have 
      higher equilibrium constant with lesser but optimal affinity for substrate and 
      cofactor than the wild type, which might be the reason for increased efficiency of 
      the mutants via enhanced substrate and cofactor exchange rate. Our study provides 
      insights into the cofactor and substrate binding affinities to PhaB enzyme at 
      atomistic level, which will facilitate designing of highly efficient PhaB enzymes 
      for increased PHB production. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.

AB  - In this work, cellulose was extracted from potato pulp, a low-efficiently utilized 
      by-product from potato starch industry, by a combined alkali and sodium sulfite 
      treatment. Its physicochemical properties were characterized and compared with 
      cellulose from corn stalk. The yield and purity of cellulose from potato pulp were 
      determined to be 24.74% and 81.34% respectively. Cellulose from potato pulp had more 
      loosened and porous structure, lower crystallinity index and larger specific surface 
      area (SSA) compared with cellulose from corn stalk. It also provided the highest 
      accessibility to cellulase (5.7 mg protein/g glucan) and had the highest enzymatic 
      digestibility (with glucose yield of 88.46%). Maximum adsorption capacity (W(max)) 
      and equilibrium constant (K) were obtained by fitting the adsorption data with the 
      Langmuir adsorption isotherm, suggesting that cellulose from potato pulp had the 
      highest cellulase adsorption efficiency. The data further indicated that the 
      presence of non-cellulosic components, especially for pectin, appeared to have a 
      considerable effect on the hydrolysis by cellulase due to non-productive adsorption.

TI  - Artificial Fusion of mCherry Enhances Trehalose Transferase Solubility and 
      Stability.
LID - 10.1128/AEM.03084-18 [doi]
LID - e03084-18
AB  - LeLoir glycosyltransferases are important biocatalysts for the production of 
      glycosidic bonds in natural products, chiral building blocks, and pharmaceuticals. 
      Trehalose transferase (TreT) is of particular interest since it catalyzes the 
      stereo- and enantioselective α,α-(1→1) coupling of a nucleotide sugar donor and 
      monosaccharide acceptor for the synthesis of disaccharide derivatives. 
      Heterologously expressed thermophilic trehalose transferases were found to be 
      intrinsically aggregation prone and are mainly expressed as catalytically active 
      inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli To disfavor protein aggregation, the 
      thermostable protein mCherry was explored as a fluorescent protein tag. The fusion 
      of mCherry to trehalose transferase from Pyrobaculum yellowstonensis (PyTreT) 
      demonstrated increased protein solubility. Chaotropic agents like guanidine or the 
      divalent cations Mn(II), Ca(II), and Mg(II) enhanced the enzyme activity of the 
      fusion protein. The thermodynamic equilibrium constant, K (eq), for the reversible 
      synthesis of trehalose from glucose and a nucleotide sugar was determined in both 
      the synthesis and hydrolysis directions utilizing UDP-glucose and ADP-glucose, 
      respectively. UDP-glucose was shown to achieve higher conversions than ADP-glucose, 
      highlighting the importance of the choice of nucleotide sugars for LeLoir 
      glycosyltransferases under thermodynamic control.IMPORTANCE The heterologous 
      expression of proteins in Escherichia coli is of great relevance for their 
      functional and structural characterization and applications. However, the formation 
      of insoluble inclusion bodies is observed in approximately 70% of all cases, and the 
      subsequent effects can range from reduced soluble protein yields to a complete 
      failure of the expression system. Here, we present an efficient methodology for the 
      production and analysis of a thermostable, aggregation-prone trehalose transferase 
      (TreT) from Pyrobaculum yellowstonensis via its fusion with mCherry as a 
      thermostable fluorescent protein tag. This fusion strategy allowed for increased 
      enzyme stability and solubility and could be applied to other (thermostable) 
      proteins, allowing rapid visualization and quantification of the mCherry-fused 
      protein of interest. Finally, we have demonstrated that the enzymatic synthesis of 
      trehalose from glucose and a nucleotide sugar is reversible by approaching the 
      thermodynamic equilibrium in both the synthesis and hydrolysis directions. Our 
      results show that uridine establishes an equilibrium constant which is more in favor 
      of the product trehalose than when adenosine is employed as the nucleotide under 
      identical conditions. The influence of different nucleotides on the reaction can be 
      generalized for all LeLoir glycosyltransferases under thermodynamic control as the 
      position of the equilibrium depends solely on the reaction conditions and is not 
      affected by the nature of the catalyst.

AB  - The native octameric structure of streptococcal enolase from Streptococcus pyogenes 
      increasingly dissociates as amino acid residues are removed one by one from the 
      carboxy-terminus. These truncations gradually convert native octameric enolase into 
      monomers and oligomers. In this work, we investigated how these truncations 
      influence the interaction between Streptococcal enolase and canine plasminogen. We 
      used dual polarization interferometry (DPI), localized surface plasmon resonance 
      (LSPR), and sedimentation velocity analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) to study the 
      interaction. The DPI was our first technique, was performed on all the truncations 
      and used one exclusive kind of chip. The LSRP was used to show that the DPI results 
      were not dependent on the type of chip used. The AUC was required to show that our 
      surface results were not the result of selecting a minority population in any given 
      sample; the majority of the protein was responsible for the binding phenomenon we 
      observed. By comparing results from these techniques we identified one detail that 
      is essential for streptococcal enolase to bind plasminogen: In our hands the 
      individual monomers bind plasminogen; dimers, trimers, tetramers may or may not 
      bind, the fully intact, native, octamer does not bind plasminogen. We also evaluated 
      the contribution to the equilibrium constant made by surface binding as well as in 
      solution. On a surface, the association coefficient is about twice that in solution. 
      The difference is probably not significant. Finally, the fully octameric form of the 
      protein that does not contain a hexa-his N-terminal peptide does not bind to a 
      silicon oxynitride surface, does not bind to an Au-nanoparticle surface, does not 
      bind to a surface coated with Ni-NTA nor does it bind to a surface coated with DPgn. 
      The likelihood is great that the enolase species on the surface of Streptococcus 
      pyogenes is an x-mer of the native octamer.

TI  - Label-Free Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) for Measuring Dissociation 
      Constants of Protein-RNA Complexes.
PG  - e70
LID - 10.1002/cpnc.70 [doi]
AB  - The electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) is a well-established method to 
      detect formation of complexes between proteins and nucleic acids and to determine, 
      among other parameters, equilibrium constants for the interaction. Mixtures of 
      protein and nucleic acid solutions of various ratios are analyzed via polyacrylamide 
      gel electrophoresis (PAGE) under native conditions. In general, protein-nucleic acid 
      complexes will migrate more slowly than the free nucleic acid. From the 
      distributions of the nucleic acid components in the observed bands in individual gel 
      lanes, quantitative parameters such as the dissociation constant (K(d) ) of the 
      interaction can be measured. This article describes a simple and rapid EMSA that 
      relies either on precast commercial or handcast polyacrylamide gels and uses 
      unlabeled protein and nucleic acid. Nucleic acids are instead detected with SYBR 
      Gold stain and band intensities established with a standard gel imaging system. We 
      used this protocol specifically to determine K(d) values for complexes between the 
      PAZ domain of Argonaute 2 (Ago2) enzyme and native and chemically modified RNA 
      oligonucleotides. EMSA-based equilibrium constants are compared to those determined 
      with isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). Advantages and limitations of this 
      simple EMSA are discussed by comparing it to other techniques used for determination 
      of equilibrium constants of protein-RNA interactions, and a troubleshooting guide is 
      provided. © 2018 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

AB  - Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) biosensor has been utilized for monitoring 
      analyte-ligand interactions in modern drug discovery processes. SPR biosensors 
      measure the change in refractive indexes over the course of analyte molecules' 
      binding to a specific immobilized ligand on sensor chip. This effort highlights a 
      comprehensive SPR study besides enzymatic assay for discovery of new Angiotensin 
      Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors via screening of medicinal plants. At first, five 
      medicinal plants were selected as potential sources for developing new ACE 
      inhibitors through hydrolyzing hippuryl-L-histidyl-L-leucine (HHL) assay. The 
      interaction of selected extracts with immobilized ACE on the sensor chip (500D) 
      confirmed that the Onopordum acanthium L. had the greatest ACE inhibition activity 
      among the set of compounds and its active compound (onopordia) was isolated. SPR 
      biosensor used to evaluate binding affinity of onopordia and ACE. Equilibrium 
      constant (K(D)), and changes in Gibb's free energy of the binding (ΔG(binding)) 
      values for the interaction of onopordia with ACE were found to be 10.24 μM and 
      -28.48 kJ/mol, respectively. Computational analysis supported the binding of 
      onopordia to the ACE active site. Kinetic and thermodynamic parameters of binding 
      revealed that onopordia is an acceptable ACE inhibitor and could treat hypertension. 
      SPR biosensor can be used to improve the drug discovery process for many important 
      classes of drug targets due to its great sensitivity.

TI  - Structural, Mechanistic, and Ultradilute Catalysis Portrayal of Substrate Inhibition 
      in the TAML-Hydrogen Peroxide Catalytic Oxidation of the Persistent Drug and 
      Micropollutant, Propranolol.
PG  - 12280-12289
LID - 10.1021/jacs.8b08108 [doi]
AB  - TAML activators enable unprecedented, rapid, ultradilute oxidation catalysis where 
      substrate inhibitions might seem improbable. Nevertheless, while TAML/H(2)O(2) 
      rapidly degrades the drug propranolol, a micropollutant (MP) of broad concern, 
      propranolol is shown to inhibit its own destruction under concentration conditions 
      amenable to kinetics studies ([propranolol] = 50 μM). Substrate inhibition manifests 
      as a decrease in the second-order rate constant k(I) for H(2)O(2) oxidation of the 
      resting Fe(III)-TAML (RC) to the activated catalyst (AC), while the second-order 
      rate constant k(II) for attack of AC on propranolol is unaffected. This kinetics 
      signature has been utilized to develop a general approach for quantifying substrate 
      inhibitions. Fragile adducts [propranolol, TAML] have been isolated and subjected to 
      ESI-MS, florescence, UV-vis, FTIR, (1)H NMR, and IC examination and DFT 
      calculations. Propranolol binds to Fe(III)-TAMLs via combinations of noncovalent 
      hydrophobic, coordinative, hydrogen bonding, and Coulombic interactions. Across four 
      studied TAMLs under like conditions, propranolol reduced k(I) 4-32-fold (pH 7, 25 
      °C) indicating that substrate inhibition is controllable by TAML design. However, 
      based on the measured k(I) and calculated equilibrium constant K for 
      propranolol-TAML binding, it is possible to project the impact on k(I) of reducing 
      [propranolol] from 50 μM to the ultradilute regime typical of MP contaminated waters 
      (≤2 ppb, ≤7 nM for propranolol) where inhibition nearly vanishes. Projecting from 50 
      μM to higher concentrations, propranolol completely inhibits its own oxidation 
      before reaching mM concentrations. This study is consistent with prior experimental 
      findings that substrate inhibition does not impede TAML/H(2)O(2) destruction of 
      propranolol in London wastewater while giving a substrate inhibition assessment tool 
      for use in the new field of ultradilute oxidation catalysis.

AB  - The genus Ochotona (pikas) is a clade of cold-tolerant lagomorphs that includes many 
      high-elevation species. Pikas offer a unique opportunity to study adaptations and 
      potential limitations of an ecologically important mammal to high-elevation hypoxia. 
      We analyzed the evolution of 3 mitochondrial genes encoding the catalytic core of 
      cytochrome c oxidase (COX) in 10 pika species occupying elevations from sea level to 
      5000 m. COX is an enzyme highly reliant on oxygen and essential for cell function. 
      One amino acid property, the equilibrium constant (ionization of COOH), was found to 
      be under selection in the overall protein complex. We observed a strong relationship 
      between the net value change in this property and the elevation each species 
      occupies, with higher-elevation species having potentially more efficient proteins. 
      We also found evidence of selection in low-elevation species for potentially less 
      efficient COX, perhaps trading efficiency for heat production in the absence of 
      hypoxia. Our results suggest that different pika species may have evolved 
      elevation-specific COX proteins, specialization that may indicate limitations in 
      their ability to shift their elevational ranges in response to future climate 
      change.

AB  - The aim of this work is the phytochemical study of the butanolic extract of the 
      aerial parts of Veronica rosea. Four compounds 1-4 have been isolated using 
      different chromatographic methods. The structures of these compounds were determined 
      by NMR spectral analysis and mass spectroscopy. The adsorption and anticorrosion 
      effects of this extract were investigated towards the corrosion of copper in 1 M 
      HNO(3) aqueous by the weight loss technique and potentiodynamic polarization. The 
      results showed that the butanolic extract is a good inhibitor and the inhibition 
      efficiency increases with increasing of concentration of the inhibitor. The 
      adsorption of this extract on the copper specimen surface was spontaneous and obeyed 
      the Langmuir's adsorption isotherm. Large value of adsorption equilibrium Constant 
      (K (ads) = 35 L g(-1)) was obtained. The polarization experiments confirmed the data 
      obtained by gravimetric weight-loss. Tafel plot of polarization curves indicates 
      that the extract acts as a mixed type inhibitor.

TI  - The mechanism of catalase loading into porous vaterite CaCO(3) crystals by 
      co-synthesis.
PG  - 8822-8831
LID - 10.1039/c7cp07836f [doi]
AB  - Porous vaterite CaCO3 crystals are nowadays extensively used as high-capacity 
      bio-friendly sacrificial templates for the fabrication of such protein-containing 
      nano- and micro-particles as capsules and beads. The first step in the protein 
      encapsulation is performed through loading of the protein molecules into the 
      crystals. Co-synthesis is one of the most useful and simple methods proven to 
      effectively load crystals with proteins; however, the loading mechanism is still 
      unknown. To understand the mechanism, in this study, we focus on the loading of a 
      model protein catalase into the crystals by means of adsorption into pre-formed 
      crystals (ADS) and co-synthesis (COS). Analysis of the physico-chemical 
      characteristics of the protein in solution and during the loading and simulation of 
      the protein packing into the crystals are performed. COS provides more effective 
      loading than ADS giving protein contents in the crystals of 20.3 and 3.5 w/w%, 
      respectively. Extremely high loading for COS providing a local protein concentration 
      of about 550 mg mL-1 is explained by intermolecular protein interactions, i.e. 
      formation of protein aggregates induced by CaCl2 during the co-synthesis. This is 
      supported by a lower equilibrium constant obtained for COS (5 × 105 M-1) than for 
      ADS (23 × 105 M-1), indicating a higher affinity of single protein molecules rather 
      than aggregates to the crystal surface. Fitting the adsorption isotherms by 
      classical adsorption models has shown that the Langmuir and BET models describe the 
      adsorption phenomenon better than the Freundlich model, proving the aggregation in 
      solution followed by adsorption of the aggregates into the crystals. We believe that 
      this study will be useful for protein encapsulation through CaCO3 crystals using the 
      COS method.

TI  - A mechanistic model to predict effects of cathepsin B and cystatin C on β-amyloid 
      aggregation and degradation.
PG  - 21071-21082
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.811448 [doi]
AB  - β-Amyloid (Aβ) aggregation is thought to initiate a cascade of neurodegenerative 
      events in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Much effort is underway to develop strategies to 
      reduce Aβ concentration or inhibit aggregation. Cathepsin B (CatB) proteolytically 
      degrades Aβ into non-aggregating fragments but is potently inhibited by cystatin C 
      (CysC). It has been suggested that decreasing CysC would facilitate Aβ clearance by 
      relieving CatB inhibition. However, CysC binds Aβ and inhibits Aβ aggregation, 
      suggesting that an intervention that increases CysC would prevent Aβ aggregation. 
      Both approaches have been tested in animal models, yielding contradictory results, 
      possibly because of the opposing influences of CysC on Aβ degradation versus 
      aggregation. Here, we sought to develop a model that quantitatively predicts the 
      effects of CysC and CatB on Aβ aggregation. Aβ aggregation kinetics in the absence 
      of CatB or CysC was measured. The rate constant for Aβ degradation by CatB and the 
      equilibrium constant for binding of CysC to Aβ were determined. We derived a 
      mathematical model that combines material balances and kinetic rate equations. The 
      model accurately predicted Aβ aggregation kinetics at various CatB and CysC 
      concentrations. We derived approximate expressions for the half-times of degradation 
      and aggregation and show that their ratio can be used to estimate, at any given Aβ, 
      CatB, or CysC concentration, whether Aβ aggregation or degradation will result. Our 
      results may be useful for designing experiments and interpreting results from 
      investigations of manipulation of CysC concentration as an AD therapy.

TI  - Search for DNA damage by human alkyladenine DNA glycosylase involves early 
      intercalation by an aromatic residue.
PG  - 16070-16080
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.782813 [doi]
AB  - DNA repair enzymes recognize and remove damaged bases that are embedded in the 
      duplex. To gain access, most enzymes use nucleotide flipping, whereby the target 
      nucleotide is rotated 180° into the active site. In human alkyladenine DNA 
      glycosylase (AAG), the enzyme that initiates base excision repair of alkylated 
      bases, the flipped-out nucleotide is stabilized by intercalation of the side chain 
      of tyrosine 162 that replaces the lesion nucleobase. Previous kinetic studies 
      provided evidence for the formation of a transient complex that precedes the stable 
      flipped-out complex, but it is not clear how this complex differs from nonspecific 
      complexes. We used site-directed mutagenesis and transient-kinetic approaches to 
      investigate the timing of Tyr(162) intercalation for AAG. The tryptophan 
      substitution (Y162W) appeared to be conservative, because the mutant protein 
      retained a highly favorable equilibrium constant for flipping the 
      1,N(6)-ethenoadenine (ϵA) lesion, and the rate of N-glycosidic bond cleavage was 
      identical to that of the wild-type enzyme. We assigned the tryptophan fluorescence 
      signal from Y162W by removing two native tryptophan residues (W270A/W284A). 
      Stopped-flow experiments then demonstrated that the change in tryptophan 
      fluorescence of the Y162W mutant is extremely rapid upon binding to either damaged 
      or undamaged DNA, much faster than the lesion-recognition and nucleotide flipping 
      steps that were independently determined by monitoring the ϵA fluorescence. These 
      observations suggest that intercalation by this aromatic residue is one of the 
      earliest steps in the search for DNA damage and that this interaction is important 
      for the progression of AAG from nonspecific searching to specific-recognition 
      complexes.

TI  - The yeast kinesin-5 Cin8 interacts with the microtubule in a noncanonical manner.
PG  - 14680-14694
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M117.797662 [doi]
AB  - Kinesin motors play central roles in establishing and maintaining the mitotic 
      spindle during cell division. Unlike most other kinesins, Cin8, a kinesin-5 motor in 
      Saccharomyces cerevisiae, can move bidirectionally along microtubules, switching 
      directionality according to biochemical conditions, a behavior that remains largely 
      unexplained. To this end, we used biochemical rate and equilibrium constant 
      measurements as well as cryo-electron microscopy methodologies to investigate the 
      microtubule interactions of the Cin8 motor domain. These experiments unexpectedly 
      revealed that, whereas Cin8 ATPase kinetics fell within measured ranges for kinesins 
      (especially kinesin-5 proteins), approximately four motors can bind each αβ-tubulin 
      dimer within the microtubule lattice. This result contrasted with those observations 
      on other known kinesins, which can bind only a single "canonical" site per tubulin 
      dimer. Competition assays with human kinesin-5 (Eg5) only partially abrogated this 
      behavior, indicating that Cin8 binds microtubules not only at the canonical site, 
      but also one or more separate ("noncanonical") sites. Moreover, we found that 
      deleting the large, class-specific insert in the microtubule-binding loop 8 reverts 
      Cin8 to one motor per αβ-tubulin in the microtubule. The novel microtubule-binding 
      mode of Cin8 identified here provides a potential explanation for Cin8 clustering 
      along microtubules and potentially may contribute to the mechanism for direction 
      reversal.

AB  - A procedure for maximization of the density of entropy production in a single 
      stationary two-step enzyme reaction is developed. Under the constraints of mass 
      conservation, fixed equilibrium constant of a reaction and fixed products of forward 
      and backward enzyme rate constants the existence of maximum in the density of 
      entropy production is demonstrated. In the state with maximal density of entropy 
      production the optimal enzyme rate constants, the stationary concentrations of the 
      substrate and the product, the stationary product yield as well as the stationary 
      reaction flux are calculated. The test, whether these calculated values of the 
      reaction parameters are consistent with their corresponding measured values, is 
      performed for the enzyme Glucose Isomerase. It is found that calculated and measured 
      rate constants agree within an order of magnitude, whereas the calculated reaction 
      flux and the product yield differ from their corresponding measured values for less 
      than 20 % and 5 %, respectively. This indicates that the enzyme Glucose Isomerase, 
      considered in a non-equilibrium stationary state, as found in experiments using the 
      continuous stirred tank reactors, possibly operates close to the state with the 
      maximum in the density of entropy production.

AB  - Detection and quantification of low-concentration proteins in heterogeneous media 
      are generally plagued by two distinct obstacles: lack of sensitivity due to high 
      dissociation equilibrium constant K(D) and non-specificity due to an abundance of 
      non-targets with similar K(D). Herein, we report a nanoscale protein-sensing 
      platform with a non-equilibrium on-off switch that employs dielectrophoretic and 
      hydrodynamic shear forces to overcome these thermodynamic limitations with 
      irreversible kinetics. The detection sensitivity is achieved with complete 
      association of the antibody-antigen-antibody (Ab-Ag-Ab) complex by precisely and 
      rapidly assembling carbon nanotubes (CNT) across two parallel electrodes via 
      sequential DC electrophoresis and AC dielectrophoresis (DEP), and with single-CNT 
      electron tunneling conductance. The high selectivity is achieved with a critical 
      hydrodynamic shear rate between the activated dissociation shear rates of target and 
      non-target linkers of the aligned CNTs. We are able to reach detection limits of 100 
      attomolar (aM) and 10 femtomolar (fM) in pure samples for two ELISA assays with low 
      and high dissociation constant: biotin/streptavidin (10 fM) and HER2/HER2 antibody 
      (0.44 ± 0.07nM), respectively. For both models, irreversible capture and shearing 
      allow us to tune the dynamic range up to 5 decades by increasing the CNT numbers. We 
      also demonstrate in spiked serum sample high selectivity towards target HER2 
      proteins against non-target HER2 isoform of a similar K(D). The detection limit for 
      HER2 in serum is lower than 100fM.

TI  - Cardiac contractility, motor function, and cross-bridge kinetics in N47K-RLC mutant 
      mice.

AB  - We have investigated the physiology and mechanical profiles of skinned papillary 
      muscle fibers from transgenic mice expressing the N47K mutation in the myosin 
      regulatory light chain (RLC), shown to cause hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in humans. 
      The results were compared with wild-type (WT) mice, both expressing the human 
      ventricular RLC. Rate constants of a cross-bridge (XB) cycle were deduced from 
      tension transients induced by sinusoidal length changes during maximal Ca(2+) 
      activation, and were studied as a function of MgATP, MgADP, and Pi concentrations. 
      N47K mutant showed slower XB cycles but higher actin-activated ATPase activity 
      compared with WT. Consequently, N47K exhibited larger tension than WT. K(0) (ADP 
      association constant) and K(4) (equilibrium constant of force generation) were 
      larger in N47K, and K(1) (ATP association constant) was slightly larger in N47K vs. 
      WT, demonstrating stronger nucleotide binding and force generation abilities of the 
      mutant, but no changes in rigor acto-myosin binding were observed. Tension per XB 
      was similar among groups, but N47K exhibited more XB distribution in the attached 
      state. Larger values of tension and higher ATPase in N47K suggested that more 
      cross-bridges participated in tension production in the mutant myocardium compared 
      with WT. In vivo analysis of heart function, performed in ~ 12.5-month-old mice by 
      echocardiography and invasive hemodynamics, demonstrated a significant decrease in 
      dP/dt(max) -end-diastolic volume relationship, indicating a depression of 
      ventricular contractility in N47K mice. Our findings suggest that the N47K mutation 
      exerts its action through direct alterations of myosin motor function that 
      ultimately result in pathological hypertrophic remodeling in N47K hearts.

AB  - Rapid detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), an etiological agent of 
      tuberculosis (TB), is important for global control of this disease. Aptamers have 
      emerged as a potential rival for antibodies in therapeutics, diagnostics and 
      biosensing due to their inherent characteristics. The aim of the current study was 
      to select and characterize single-stranded DNA aptamers against MPT64 protein, one 
      of the predominant secreted proteins of Mtb pathogen. Aptamers specific to MPT64 
      protein were selected in vitro using systematic evolution of ligands through 
      exponential enrichment (SELEX) method. The selection was started with a pool of 
      ssDNA library with randomized 40-nucleotide region. A total of 10 cycles were 
      performed and seventeen aptamers with unique sequences were identified by 
      sequencing. Dot Blot analysis was performed to monitor the SELEX process and to 
      conduct the preliminary tests on the affinity and specificity of aptamers. Enzyme 
      linked oligonucleotide assay (ELONA) showed that most of the aptamers were specific 
      to the MPT64 protein with a linear correlation of R(2) = 0.94 for the most 
      selective. Using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR), dissociation equilibrium constant 
      K(D) of 8.92 nM was obtained. Bioinformatics analysis of the most specific aptamers 
      revealed the existence of a conserved as well as distinct sequences and possible 
      binding site on MPT64. The specificity was determined by testing non-target ESAT-6 
      and CFP-10. Negligible cross-reactivity confirmed the high specificity of the 
      selected aptamer. The selected aptamer was further tested on clinical sputum samples 
      using ELONA and had sensitivity and specificity of 91.3% and 90%, respectively. 
      Microscopy, culture positivity and nucleotide amplification methods were used as 
      reference standards. The aptamers studied could be further used for the development 
      of medical diagnostic tools and detection assays for Mtb.

AB  - The cardiac troponin C (TnC)-A8V mutation is associated with hypertrophic and 
      restrictive cardiomyopathy (HCM and RCM) in human and mice. The residue affected 
      lies in the N-helix, a region known to affect Ca(2+)-binding affinity to the 
      N-terminal domain. Here we report on the functional effects of this mutation in 
      skinned papillary muscle fibers from homozygous knock-in TnC-A8V mice. Muscle fibers 
      from left ventricle were activated at 25°C under the ionic conditions of working 
      cardiomyocytes. The pCa-tension relationship showed a 3× increase in 
      Ca(2+)-sensitivity and a decrease (0.8×) in cooperativity (n(H)) in mutant fibers. 
      The elementary steps of the cross-bridge (CB) cycle were investigated by sinusoidal 
      analysis. The ATP study revealed that there is no significant change in the affinity 
      of ATP (K(1)) for the myosin head. In TnC-A8V mutant fibers, the CB detachment rate 
      (k(2)) and its equilibrium constant (K(2)) increased (1.5×). The phosphate study 
      revealed that rate constant of the force-generation step (k(4)) decreased (0.5×), 
      reversal step (k(-4)) increased (2×), and the phosphate-release step (1/K(5)) 
      increased (2×). Pro-Q Diamond staining of the skinned fibers samples revealed no 
      significant changes in total phosphorylation of multiple sarcomeric proteins. 
      Further investigation using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry revealed 
      hypophosphorylation of the rod domain of myosin heavy chain in TnC-A8V mutant fibers 
      compared to wild-type. Immunoblotting confirmed the results observed in the mass 
      spectrometry analysis. The results suggest perturbed CB kinetics-possibly caused by 
      changes in the α-myosin heavy chain phosphorylation profile-as a novel mechanism, to 
      our knowledge, by which a mutation in TnC can have rippling effects in the 
      myofilament and contribute to the pathogenesis of HCM/RCM.

AB  - Fast turnover of ferredoxin/Fd reduction by photosystem-I/PSI requires that it 
      dissociates rapidly after it has been reduced by PSI:Fd intracomplex electron 
      transfer. The rate constants of Fd dissociation from PSI have been determined by 
      flash-absorption spectroscopy with different combinations of cyanobacterial PSIs and 
      Fds, and different redox states of Fd and of the terminal PSI acceptor (F(A)F(B)). 
      Newly obtained values were derived firstly from the fact that the dissociation 
      constant between PSI and redox-inactive gallium-substituted Fd increases upon 
      (F(A)F(B)) reduction and secondly from the characterization and elucidation of a 
      kinetic phase following intracomplex Fd reduction to binding of oxidized Fd to PSI, 
      a process which is rate-limited by the foregoing dissociation of reduced Fd from 
      PSI. By reference to the complex with oxidized partners, dissociation rate constants 
      were found to increase moderately with (F(A)F(B)) single reduction and by about one 
      order of magnitude after electron transfer from (F(A)F(B))(-) to Fd, therefore 
      favoring turnover of Fd reduction by PSI. With Thermosynechococcus elongatus 
      partners, values of 270, 730 and >10000s(-1) were thus determined for 
      (F(A)F(B))Fd(oxidized), (F(A)F(B))(-)Fd(oxidized) and (F(A)F(B))Fd(reduced), 
      respectively. Moreover, assuming a conservative upper limit for the association rate 
      constant between reduced Fd and PSI, a significant negative shift of the Fd midpoint 
      potential upon binding to PSI has been calculated (< -60mV for Thermosynechococcus 
      elongatus). From the present state of knowledge, the question is still open whether 
      this redox shift is compatible with a large (>10) equilibrium constant for 
      intracomplex reduction of Fd from (F(A)F(B))(-).

TI  - Tight binding of heme to Staphylococcus aureus IsdG and IsdI precludes design of a 
      competitive inhibitor.
PG  - 556-563
LID - 10.1039/c7mt00035a [doi]
AB  - The micromolar equilibrium constants for heme dissociation from IsdG and IsdI 
      reported in the literature call into question whether these enzymes are actually 
      members of the iron-regulated surface determinant system of Staphylococcus aureus, 
      which harvests heme iron from a host during infection. In order to address this 
      question, the heme dissociation constants for IsdG and IsdI were reevaluated using 
      three approaches. The heme dissociation equilibrium constants were measured using a 
      UV/Vis absorption-detected assay analyzed with an assumption-free model, and using a 
      newly developed fluorescence-detected assay. The heme dissociation rate constants 
      were estimated using apomyoglobin competition assays. Analyses of the UV/Vis 
      absorption data revealed a critical flaw in the previous measurements; heme is 99.9% 
      protein-bound at the micromolar concentrations needed for UV/Vis absorption 
      spectroscopy, which renders accurate equilibrium constant measurement nearly 
      impossible. However, fluorescence can be measured for more dilute samples, and 
      analyses of these data resulted in dissociation equilibrium constants of 1.4 ± 0.6 
      nM and 12.9 ± 1.3 nM for IsdG and IsdI, respectively. Analyses of the kinetic data 
      obtained from apomyoglobin competition assays estimated heme dissociation rate 
      constants of 0.022 ± 0.002 s(-1) for IsdG and 0.092 ± 0.008 s(-1) for IsdI. Based 
      upon these data, and what is known regarding the post-translational regulation of 
      IsdG and IsdI, it is proposed that only IsdG is a member of the heme iron 
      acquisition pathway and IsdI regulates heme homeostasis. Furthermore, the nanomolar 
      dissociation constants mean that heme is bound tightly by IsdG and indicates that 
      competitive inhibition of this protein will be difficult. Instead, uncompetitive 
      inhibition based upon a detailed understanding of enzyme mechanism is a more 
      promising antibiotic development strategy.

TI  - Exploring the Landscape of Diazabicyclooctane (DBO) Inhibition: Avibactam 
      Inactivation of PER-2 β-Lactamase.
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02476-16 [doi]
LID - e02476-16
AB  - PER β-lactamases are an emerging family of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) 
      found in Gram-negative bacteria. PER β-lactamases are unique among class A enzymes 
      as they possess an inverted omega (Ω) loop and extended B3 β-strand. These singular 
      structural features are hypothesized to contribute to their hydrolytic profile 
      against oxyimino-cephalosporins (e.g., cefotaxime and ceftazidime). Here, we tested 
      the ability of avibactam (AVI), a novel non-β-lactam β-lactamase inhibitor to 
      inactivate PER-2. Interestingly, the PER-2 inhibition constants (i.e., k(2)/K = 2 × 
      10(3) ± 0.1 × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), where k(2) is the rate constant for acylation 
      (carbamylation) and K is the equilibrium constant) that were obtained when AVI was 
      tested were reminiscent of values observed testing the inhibition by AVI of class C 
      and D β-lactamases (i.e., k(2)/K range of ≈10(3) M(-1) s(-1)) and not class A 
      β-lactamases (i.e., k(2)/K range, 10(4) to 10(5) M(-1) s(-1)). Once AVI was bound, a 
      stable complex with PER-2 was observed via mass spectrometry (e.g., 31,389 ± 3 
      atomic mass units [amu] → 31,604 ± 3 amu for 24 h). Molecular modeling of PER-2 with 
      AVI showed that the carbonyl of AVI was located in the oxyanion hole of the 
      β-lactamase and that the sulfate of AVI formed interactions with the β-lactam 
      carboxylate binding site of the PER-2 β-lactamase (R220 and T237). However, 
      hydrophobic patches near the PER-2 active site (by Ser70 and B3-B4 β-strands) were 
      observed and may affect the binding of necessary catalytic water molecules, thus 
      slowing acylation (k(2)/K) of AVI onto PER-2. Similar electrostatics and 
      hydrophobicity of the active site were also observed between OXA-48 and PER-2, while 
      CTX-M-15 was more hydrophilic. To demonstrate the ability of AVI to overcome the 
      enhanced cephalosporinase activity of PER-2 β-lactamase, we tested different 
      β-lactam-AVI combinations. By lowering MICs to ≤2 mg/liter, the ceftaroline-AVI 
      combination could represent a favorable therapeutic option against 
      Enterobacteriaceae expressing bla(PER-2) Our studies define the inactivation of the 
      PER-2 ESBL by AVI and suggest that the biophysical properties of the active site 
      contribute to determining the efficiency of inactivation.

AB  - Omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), a putative heart failure therapeutic, increases cardiac 
      contractility. We hypothesize that it does this by changing the structural kinetics 
      of the myosin powerstroke. We tested this directly by performing transient 
      time-resolved FRET on a ventricular cardiac myosin biosensor. Our results 
      demonstrate that OM stabilizes myosin's prepowerstroke structural state, supporting 
      previous measurements showing that the drug shifts the equilibrium constant for 
      myosin-catalyzed ATP hydrolysis toward the posthydrolysis biochemical state. OM 
      slowed the actin-induced powerstroke, despite a twofold increase in the rate 
      constant for actin-activated phosphate release, the biochemical step in myosin's 
      ATPase cycle associated with force generation and the conversion of chemical energy 
      into mechanical work. We conclude that OM alters the energetics of cardiac myosin's 
      mechanical cycle, causing the powerstroke to occur after myosin weakly binds to 
      actin and releases phosphate. We discuss the physiological implications for these 
      changes.

TI  - Diffusion and Binding of Mismatch Repair Protein, MSH2, in Breast Cancer Cells at 
      Different Stages of Neoplastic Transformation.
PG  - e0170414

LID - e0170414
AB  - The interior of cells is a highly complex medium, containing numerous organelles, a 
      matrix of different fibers and a viscous, aqueous fluid of proteins and small 
      molecules. The interior of cells is also a highly dynamic medium, in which many 
      components move, either by active transport or passive diffusion. The mobility and 
      localization of proteins inside cells can provide important insights into protein 
      function and also general cellular properties, such as viscosity. Neoplastic 
      transformation affects numerous cellular properties, and our goal was to investigate 
      the diffusional and binding behavior of the important mismatch repair (MMR) protein 
      MSH2 in live human cells at various stages of neoplastic transformation. Toward this 
      end, noncancerous, immortal, tumorigenic, and metastatic mammary epithelial cells 
      were transfected with EGFP and EGFP-tagged MSH2. MSH2 forms two MMR proteins (MutSα 
      and MutSβ) and we assume MSH2 is in the complex MutSα, though our results are 
      similar in either case. Unlike the MutS complexes that bind to nuclear DNA, EGFP 
      diffuses freely. EGFP and MutSα-EGFP diffusion coefficients were determined in the 
      cytoplasm and nucleus of each cell type using fluorescence recovery after 
      photobleaching. Diffusion coefficients were 14-24 μm2/s for EGFP and 3-7 μm2/s for 
      MutSα-EGFP. EGFP diffusion increased in going from noncancerous to immortal cells, 
      indicating a decrease in viscosity, with smaller changes in subsequent stages. MutSα 
      produces an effective diffusion coefficient that, coupled with the free EGFP 
      diffusion measurements, can be used to extract a pure diffusion coefficient and a 
      pseudo-equilibrium constant K*. The MutSα nuclear K* increased sixfold in the first 
      stage of cancer and then decreased in the more advanced stages. The ratio of nuclear 
      to cytoplasmic K*for MutSα increased almost two orders of magnitude in going from 
      noncancerous to immortal cells, suggesting that this quantity may be a sensitive 
      metric for recognizing the onset of cancer.

      Bind GI Noroviruses.
PG  - e0170162
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0170162 [doi]
LID - e0170162
AB  - Norovirus infections commonly lead to outbreaks of acute gastroenteritis and spread 
      quickly, resulting in many health and economic challenges prior to diagnosis. Rapid 
      and reliable diagnostic tests are therefore essential to identify infections and to 
      guide the appropriate clinical responses at the point-of-care. Existing tools, 
      including RT-PCR and enzyme immunoassays, pose several limitations based on the 
      significant time, equipment and expertise required to elicit results. 
      Immunochromatographic assays available for use at the point-of-care have poor 
      sensitivity and specificity, especially for genogroup I noroviruses, thus requiring 
      confirmation of results with more sensitive testing methods. Therefore, there is a 
      clear need for novel reagents to help achieve quick and reliable results. In this 
      study, we have identified two novel single-chain antibodies (scFvs)-named NJT-R3-A2 
      and NJT-R3-A3-that effectively detect GI.1 and GI.7 virus-like particles (VLPs) 
      through selection of a phage display library against the P-domain of the GI.1 major 
      capsid protein. The limits of detection by each scFv for GI.1 and GI.7 are 0.1 and 
      0.2 ng, and 6.25 and 25 ng, respectively. They detect VLPs with strong specificity 
      in multiple diagnostic formats, including ELISAs and membrane-based dot blots, and 
      in the context of norovirus-negative stool suspensions. The scFvs also detect native 
      virions effectively in norovirus-positive clinical stool samples. Purified scFvs 
      bind to GI.1 and GI.7 VLPs with equilibrium constant (KD) values of 27 nM and 49 nM, 
      respectively. Overall, the phage-based scFv reagents identified and characterized 
      here show utility for detecting GI.1 and GI.7 noroviruses in multiple diagnostic 
      assay formats with strong specificity and sensitivity, indicating promise for 
      integration into existing point-of-care tests to improve future diagnostics.

PG  - 1222-1239
LID - 10.1021/acs.jpcb.6b10465 [doi]
AB  - Interaction of two food colorant dyes, amaranth and tartrazine, with lysozyme was 
      studied employing multiple biophysical techniques. The dyes exhibited hypochromic 
      changes in the presence of lysozyme. The intrinsic fluorescence of lysozyme was 
      quenched by both dyes; amaranth was a more efficient quencher than tartrazine. The 
      equilibrium constant of amaranth was higher than that of tartarzine. From FRET 
      analysis, the binding distances for amaranth and tartrazine were calculated to be 
      4.51 and 3.93 nm, respectively. The binding was found to be dominated by 
      non-polyelectrolytic forces. Both dyes induced alterations in the microenvironment 
      surrounding the tryptophan and tyrosine residues of the protein, with the 
      alterations being comparatively higher for the tryptophans than the tyrosines. The 
      interaction caused significant loss in the helicity of lysozyme, the change being 
      higher with amaranth. The binding of both dyes was exothermic. The binding of 
      amaranth was enthalpy driven, while that of tartrazine was predominantly entropy 
      driven. Amaranth delayed lysozyme fibrillation at 25 μM, while tartrazine had no 
      effect even at 100 μM. Nevertheless, both dyes had a significant inhibitory effect 
      on fibrillogenesis. The present study explores the potential antiamyloidogenic 
      property of these azo dyes used as food colorants.

AB  - 1.4 Protein arginine deiminases 4 (PAD4) is an attractive target for the development 
      of novel and selective inhibitors of Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA). F-amidine is known 
      as mechanism-based inhibitor targeting PAD4 and used as inactivators by covalently 
      modifying the active site Cys645. To identify novel structural inhibitors of PAD4, 
      we investigated the flexibility of protein on basis of the transition state geometry 
      of PAD4 inhibited by F-amidine from our previous QM/MM calculation. And a 
      pharmacophore model was generated containing four features (ADHH) using five 
      representative structures from molecular dynamic (MD) simulation on basis of the 
      transition state geometry of PAD4 inhibited by F-amidine. We performed virtual 
      screening using the pharmacophore model and molecular docking methods, resulting in 
      the discovery of two molecules with K(D) (dissociation equilibrium constant) values 
      of 112μM and 218μΜ against PAD4 through Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) experiments. 
      These two molecules could potentially serve as PAD4 inhibitors.

AB  - The access to kinetic parameters of lipolytic enzyme adsorption onto lipids is 
      essential for a better understanding of the overall catalytic process carried out by 
      these interfacial enzymes. Gastric lipase, for instance, shows an apparent optimum 
      activity on triglycerides (TAG) at acidic pH, which is controlled by its 
      pH-dependent adsorption at lipid-water interfaces. Since gastric lipase acts on TAG 
      droplets covered by phospholipids, but does not hydrolyze these lipids, phospholipid 
      monolayers spread at the air-water interfaces can be used as biomimetic interfaces 
      to study lipase adsorption and penetration through the phospholipid layer, 
      independently from the catalytic activity. The adsorption of recombinant dog gastric 
      lipase (rDGL) onto 1,2-dilauroyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DLPC) monolayers can 
      be monitored by surface tensiometry at various enzyme concentrations, pHs, and 
      surface pressures (Π). These experimental data and the use of Langmuir adsorption 
      isotherm and Verger-de Haas' lipase kinetics models further allow estimating various 
      parameters including the adsorption equilibrium constant (K(Ads)), the interfacial 
      concentration [Formula: see text] , the molar fraction [Formula: see text] 
      (Φ(E*(%)), mol%), and the molecular area [Formula: see text] of rDGL adsorbed onto 
      the DLPC monolayer under various conditions. Additional insight into rDGL 
      adsorption/insertion on phospholipid monolayers can be obtained by combining 
      ellipsometry, Langmuir-Blodgett film transfer, and atomic force microscopy. When 
      using multicomponent phospholipid monolayers with phase separation, these techniques 
      allow to visualizing how rDGL preferentially partitions toward liquid expanded phase 
      and at phase boundaries, gets adsorbed at various levels of insertion and impacts on 
      the lateral organization of lipids.

TI  - Comparison of elementary steps of the cross-bridge cycle in rat papillary muscle 
      fibers expressing α- and β-myosin heavy chain with sinusoidal analysis.
PG  - 203-214
LID - 10.1007/s10974-016-9456-2 [doi]
AB  - In mammalian ventricles, two myosin heavy chain (MHC) isoforms have been identified. 
      Small animals express α-MHC, whereas large animals express β-MHC, which contribute 
      to a large difference in the heart rate. Sprague-Dawley rats possessing ~99% α-MHC 
      were treated with propylthiouracil to result in 100% β-MHC. Papillary muscles were 
      skinned, dissected into small fibers, and used for experiments. To understand the 
      functional difference between α-MHC and β-MHC, skinned-fibers were activated under 
      the intracellular ionic conditions: 5 mM MgATP, 1 mM Mg(2+), 8 mM Pi, 200 mM ionic 
      strength, pH 7.00 at 25 °C. Small amplitude sinusoidal length oscillations were 
      applied in the frequency range 0.13-100 Hz (corresponding time domain: 1.6-1200 ms), 
      and effects of Ca(2+), Pi, and ATP were studied. The results show that Ca(2+) 
      sensitivity was slightly less (10-15%) in β-MHC than α-MHC containing fibers. 
      Sinusoidal analysis at pCa 4.66 (full Ca(2+) activation) demonstrated that, the 
      apparent rate constants were 2-4× faster in α-MHC containing fibers. The ATP study 
      demonstrated that, in β-MHC containing fibers, K (1) (ATP association constant) was 
      greater (1.7×), k (2) and k (-2) (cross-bridge detachment and its reversal rate 
      constants) were smaller (×0.6). The Pi study demonstrated that, in β-MHC containing 
      fibers, k (4) (rate constant of the force-generation step) and k (-4) were smaller 
      (0.75× and 0.25×, respectively), resulting in greater K (4) (3×). There were no 
      differences in active tension, rigor stiffness, or K (2) (equilibrium constant of 
      the cross-bridge detachment step). Our study further demonstrated that there were no 
      differences in parameters between fibers obtained from left and right ventricles, 
      but with an exception in K (5) (Pi association constant).

TI  - Volumetrically Derived Thermodynamic Profile of Interactions of Urea with a Native 
      Protein.
PG  - 6475-6483
AB  - We report the first experimental characterization of the full thermodynamic profile 
      for binding of urea to a native protein. We measured the volumetric parameters of 
      lysozyme at pH 7.0 as a function of urea within a temperature range of 18-45 °C. At 
      neutral pH, lysozyme retains its native conformation between 0 and 8 M urea over the 
      entire range of temperatures studied. Consequently, our measured volumetric 
      properties reflect solely the interactions of urea with the native protein and do 
      not involve contributions from urea-induced conformational transitions. We analyzed 
      our data within the framework of a statistical thermodynamic analytical model in 
      which urea-protein interactions are viewed as solvent exchange in the vicinity of 
      the protein. The analysis produced the equilibrium constant, k, for an elementary 
      reaction of urea-protein binding with a change in standard state free energy (ΔG° = 
      -RT ln k) at each experimental temperature. We used the van't Hoff equation to 
      compute from the temperature dependence of the equilibrium constant, k, changes in 
      enthalpy, ΔH°, and entropy, ΔS°, accompanying binding. The thermodynamic profile of 
      urea-protein interactions, in conjunction with published molecular dynamics 
      simulation results, is consistent with the picture in which urea molecules, being 
      underhydrated in the bulk, form strong, enthalpically favorable interactions with 
      the surface protein groups while paying a high entropic price. We discuss 
      ramifications of our results for providing insights into the combined effects of 
      urea, temperature, and pressure on the conformational preferences of proteins.

AB  - Dimerization of membrane protein interfaces occurs during membrane protein folding 
      and cell receptor signaling. Here, we summarize a method that allows for measurement 
      of equilibrium dimerization reactions of membrane proteins in lipid bilayers, by 
      measuring the Poisson distribution of subunit capture into liposomes by 
      single-molecule photobleaching analysis. This strategy is grounded in the fact that 
      given a comparable labeling efficiency, monomeric or dimeric forms of a membrane 
      protein will give rise to distinctly different photobleaching probability 
      distributions. These methods have been used to verify the dimer stoichiometry of the 
      Fluc F(-) ion channel and the dimerization equilibrium constant of the ClC-ec1 
      Cl(-)/H(+) antiporter in lipid bilayers. This approach can be applied to any 
      membrane protein system provided it can be purified, fluorescently labeled in a 
      quantitative manner, and verified to be correctly folded by functional assays, even 
      if the structure is not yet known.

TI  - Six-Transmembrane Epithelial Antigen of Prostate 1 (STEAP1) Has a Single b Heme and 
      Is Capable of Reducing Metal Ion Complexes and Oxygen.
PG  - 6673-6684
AB  - STEAP1, six-transmembrane epithelial antigen of prostate member 1, is strongly 
      expressed in several types of cancer cells, particularly in prostate cancer, and 
      inhibition of its expression reduces the rate of tumor cell proliferation. However, 
      the physiological function of STEAP1 remains unknown. Here for the first time, we 
      purified a mammalian (rabbit) STEAP1 at a milligram level, permitting its 
      high-quality biochemical and biophysical characterizations. We found that STEAP1 
      likely assembles as a homotrimer and forms a heterotrimer when co-expressed with 
      STEAP2. Each STEAP1 protomer binds one heme prosthetic group that is mainly low-spin 
      with a pair of histidine axial ligands, with small portions of high-spin and 
      P450-type heme. In its ferrous state, STEAP1 is capable of reducing transition metal 
      ion complexes of Fe(3+) and Cu(2+). Ferrous STEAP1 also reacts readily with O(2) 
      through an outer sphere redox mechanism. Kinetics with all three substrates are 
      biphasic with ∼80 and ∼20% for the fast and slow phases, respectively, in line with 
      its heme heterogeneity. STEAP1 retained a low level of bound FAD during 
      purification, and the binding equilibrium constant, K(D), was ∼30 μM. These results 
      highlight STEAP as a novel metal reductase and superoxide synthase and establish a 
      solid basis for further research into understanding how STEAP1 activities may affect 
      cancer progression.

AB  - Abnormal levels of fibrinogen (Fib) in blood plasma are associated with several 
      pathological conditions and hence methods for its detection in blood and body fluids 
      are essential. Nanobodies (Nbs) or (VHHs) are single domain antibodies derived from 
      camelids with excellent biophysical and antigen-binding properties, showing great 
      promise in diagnostics and therapy. In this work, we select and characterize high 
      affinity Nbs binding human Fib employing an E. coli cell surface display system 
      based on the fusion of an immune library of VHH domains with the β-domain of 
      Intimin. Bacteria displaying high-affinity Nbs against Fib were selected using 
      magnetic cell sorting (MACS). Specific binding of the selected clones to Fib was 
      confirmed by flow cytometry of E. coli bacteria, as well as by enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and surface plasmon resonance (SPR) with the purified 
      Nbs. E. coli display also provided an excellent estimation of the affinity of the 
      selected Nbs by flow cytometry analysis under equilibrium conditions, with 
      equilibrium constant (KD) values very similar to those obtained by SPR analysis. 
      Finally, pairwise epitope-scouting studies revealed that the selected Nbs bound 
      distinct epitopes on Fib. The selected Nbs are promising diagnostic tools for 
      determination of human Fib levels.

TI  - Generating monomeric 5-coordinated microperoxidase-11 using carboxylic acid 
      functionalized silver nanoparticles: A surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering 
      analysis.

AB  - Microperoxidase-11 (MP-11), a heme undecapeptide obtained by proteolytic digestion 
      of cytochrome c, resembles peroxidase enzyme when its heme center is 5-coordinated 
      with a vacant sixth coordination site. However, MP-11 always tends to aggregate in 
      both solution and on surface and eventually forms the 6-coordinated heme. Thus, the 
      present study investigates the immobilization strategy of MP-11 on nanoparticle 
      surface in order to generate monomeric 5-coordinated MP-11 and make them as an 
      efficient biocatalyst. The powerful surface-enhanced resonance Raman scattering 
      (SERRS) technique is being employed to attain the detailed structural information of 
      the catalytic site i.e., the heme center. The localized surface plasmon resonance 
      (LSPR) tuned and 6-mercaptohexanoic acid (MHA) functionalized silver nanoparticles 
      (Ag@MHA NPs) are used as Raman signal amplifier. The outcome of the SERRS study 
      unambiguously portrays the existence of monomeric 5-coordinated MP-11 on Ag@MHA NPs 
      surface. Here, Ag@MHA NPs plays a dual role of providing a platform to create 
      monomeric 5-coordinated MP-11 and to load large number of MP-11 due to its high 
      surface to volume ratio. Further, the electrostatic interaction between Ag@MHA NPs 
      and MP-11 leads to instantaneous SERRS signal enhancement with a Raman enhancement 
      factor (EFSERS) of 2.36×10(6). Langmuir adsorption isotherm has been employed for 
      the adsorption of MP-11 on Ag@MHA NPs surface, which provides the real surface 
      coverage (ΓS(*)) and equilibrium constant (K) value of 1.54nm and 5×10(11)M(-1). 
      Furthermore, the peroxidase activity of MP-11 has been demonstrated through 
      electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction.

TI  - Cyanide binding to ferrous and ferric microperoxidase-11.
PG  - 511-22
LID - 10.1007/s00775-016-1361-z [doi]
AB  - Microperoxidase-11 (MP11) is an undecapeptide derived from horse heart cytochrome c 
      (cytc). MP11 is characterized by a covalently linked solvent-exposed heme group, the 
      heme-Fe atom being axially coordinated by a histidyl residue. Here, the reactions of 
      ferrous and ferric MP11 (MP11-Fe(II) and MP11-Fe(III), respectively) with cyanide 
      have been investigated from the kinetic and thermodynamic viewpoints, at pH 7.0 and 
      20.0 °C. Values of the second-order rate constant for cyanide binding to MP11-Fe(II) 
      and MP11-Fe(III) are 4.5 M(-1) s(-1) and 8.9 × 10(3) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. 
      Values of the first-order rate constant for cyanide dissociation from ligated 
      MP11-Fe(II) and MP11-Fe(III) are 1.8 × 10(-1) s(-1) and 1.5 × 10(-3) s(-1), 
      respectively. Values of the dissociation equilibrium constant for cyanide binding to 
      MP11-Fe(II) and MP11-Fe(III) are 3.7 × 10(-2) and 1.7 × 10(-7) M, respectively, 
      matching very well with those calculated from kinetic parameters so that no 
      intermediate species seem to be involved in the ligand-binding process. The 
      pH-dependence of cyanide binding to MP11-Fe(III) indicates that CN(-) is the only 
      binding species. Present results have been analyzed in parallel with those of 
      several heme-proteins, suggesting that (1) the ligand accessibility to the metal 
      center and cyanide ionization may modulate the formation of heme-Fe-cyanide 
      complexes, and (2) the general polarity of the heme pocket and/or hydrogen bonding 
      of the heme-bound ligand may affect cyanide exit from the protein matrix. 
      Microperoxidase-11 (MP11) is an undecapeptide derived from horse heart cytochrome c. 
      Penta-coordinated MP11 displays a very high reactivity towards cyanide, whereas the 
      reactivity of hexa-coordinated horse heart cytochrome c is very low.

TI  - Metabolite concentrations, fluxes and free energies imply efficient enzyme usage.
PG  - 482-9
LID - 10.1038/nchembio.2077 [doi]
AB  - In metabolism, available free energy is limited and must be divided across pathway 
      steps to maintain a negative ΔG throughout. For each reaction, ΔG is log 
      proportional both to a concentration ratio (reaction quotient to equilibrium 
      constant) and to a flux ratio (backward to forward flux). Here we use isotope 
      labeling to measure absolute metabolite concentrations and fluxes in Escherichia 
      coli, yeast and a mammalian cell line. We then integrate this information to obtain 
      a unified set of concentrations and ΔG for each organism. In glycolysis, we find 
      that free energy is partitioned so as to mitigate unproductive backward fluxes 
      associated with ΔG near zero. Across metabolism, we observe that absolute metabolite 
      concentrations and ΔG are substantially conserved and that most substrate (but not 
      inhibitor) concentrations exceed the associated enzyme binding site dissociation 
      constant (Km or Ki). The observed conservation of metabolite concentrations is 
      consistent with an evolutionary drive to utilize enzymes efficiently given 
      thermodynamic and osmotic constraints.

AB  - Marine sponges are found to be a wide source of bioactive compounds with different 
      effects such as anti-inflammatory or anticancer actions among others. Cyclophilin A 
      (Cyp A) is a target protein implicated in the mechanism of action of 
      immunosuppressive compounds such as Cyclosporine A (CsA). In the present paper we 
      studied the binding between 4 Spongionella compounds (Gracilins H, A, L and 
      Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1) and Cyp A immobilized over a CM5 sensor chip. Thus, we 
      found that Spongionella compounds showed to have similar binding affinities than CsA 
      with dissociation equilibrium constant in the range. Next, the effect of these 
      Spongionella isolated compounds was tested over calcineurin phosphatase activity. 
      The same than CsA, Gracilin H, A and Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1 were able to inhibit 
      phosphatase activity once the complex between Cyp A-CsA/Spongionella compounds was 
      formed. The ability to avoid the dephosphorylation of NFATc1 was also checked in 
      human T cells isolated from peripheral blood. First, cells were pre-treated with 
      Spongionella compounds or CsA following by Concanavalin A (Con A) stimulation. In 
      these conditions nuclear NFATc1 levels were diminished either by CsA or Gracilin A, 
      L, and Tetrahydroaplysulphurin-1 treatment. Moreover, as happens with CsA due to the 
      inhibition of NFATc1, Interleukine-2 (IL-2) released to the culture medium was 
      significantly decreased with all Spongionella compounds. Results conclude that, 
      Spongionella derivatives preserve T lymphocytes from activation modulating the same 
      pathway than CsA. Thus, this mechanism of action suggests that these compounds could 
      be interesting candidates in drug development as immunosuppressive or 
      anti-inflammatory drugs.

AB  - Surface plasmon resonance (SPR) immunosensor has been widely utilized for monitoring 
      antigen-antibody interactions. The sensor measures changes of refractive index upon 
      binding of analyte molecules to specific ligand immobilized on the sensor chip. This 
      effort reports development of SPR immunosensor for real-time and label-free 
      detection of recombinant human matrix metalloproteinases-9 (MMP-9), which has been 
      associated with malignant tumor progression and metastasis by matrix degradation. 
      MMP-9 was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified by Ni-NTA agarose column. 
      CMD 50 D was activated by EDC/NHS for immobilization of monoclonal anti-MMP-9. 
      Atomic force microscopy images showed uniform distribution of anti-MMP-9 over the 
      sensor chip. Equilibrium constant (KD), maximum binding capacity (Rmax) and ∆Gb 
      values for interaction of MMP-9 and anti-MMP-9 were 0.4nM, 680 µRIU and 
      -53.51kJ/mol, respectively. Concentration of MMP-9 in saliva samples was determined, 
      with linearity in the range of 10-200ng/mL. The limit of detection was found to be 
      8pg/mL, being lower than most of the previously reported techniques.

AB  - To achieve rapid and sensitive detection of cancer, activatable fluorescent probes 
      targeting proteases that are overexpressed in various types of cancer have been 
      developed, based on the hydroxymethyl rhodamine green (HMRG) scaffold. However, to 
      visualize altered activities of multiple enzymes in cancer sites, other scaffolds 
      with distinct fluorescence properties from those of HMRG are needed. A novel 
      asymmetrically modified rhodamine with suitable absorption/emission, brightness and 
      equilibrium constant of intramolecular spirocyclization, working in the 
      yellow/orange region, is introduced. As a proof of concept, a probe targeting 
      γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (gGlu-HMJCR) was developed on the basis of the new 
      scaffold. Simultaneous visualization and discrimination of tumours expressing 
      γ-glutamyl transpeptidase (with gGlu-HMJCR) and cathepsins (with Z-Phe-Arg-HMRG) by 
      colour were achieved in a mouse model in vivo.

AB  - A theoretical model of elastically coupled reactions is proposed for single molecule 
      imaging and rotor manipulation experiments on F1-ATPase. Stalling experiments are 
      considered in which rates of individual ligand binding, ligand release, and chemical 
      reaction steps have an exponential dependence on rotor angle. These data are treated 
      in terms of the effect of thermodynamic driving forces on reaction rates, and lead 
      to equations relating rate constants and free energies to the stalling angle. These 
      relations, in turn, are modeled using a formalism originally developed to treat 
      electron and other transfer reactions. During stalling the free energy profile of 
      the enzymatic steps is altered by a work term due to elastic structural twisting. 
      Using biochemical and single molecule data, the dependence of the rate constant and 
      equilibrium constant on the stall angle, as well as the Børnsted slope are predicted 
      and compared with experiment. Reasonable agreement is found with stalling 
      experiments for ATP and GTP binding. The model can be applied to other 
      torque-generating steps of reversible ligand binding, such as ADP and Pi release, 
      when sufficient data become available.

AB  - Photosynthetic water oxidation to molecular oxygen is carried out by photosystem II 
      (PSII) over a reaction cycle involving four photochemical steps that drive the 
      oxygen-evolving complex through five redox states Si (i = 0,…, 4). For understanding 
      the catalytic strategy of biological water oxidation it is important to elucidate 
      the energetic landscape of PSII and in particular that of the final S4 → S0 
      transition. In this short-lived chemical step the four oxidizing equivalents 
      accumulated in the preceding photochemical events are used up to form molecular 
      oxygen, two protons are released and at least one substrate water molecule binds to 
      the Mn4CaO5 cluster. In this study we probed the probability to form S4 from S0 and 
      O2 by incubating YD-less PSII in the S0 state for 2–3 days in the presence of (18)O2 
      and H2(16)O. The absence of any measurable (16,18)O2 formation by water-exchange in 
      the S4 state suggests that the S4 state is hardly ever populated. On the basis of a 
      detailed analysis we determined that the equilibrium constant K of the S4 → S0 
      transition is larger than 1.0 × 10(7) so that this step is highly exergonic. We 
      argue that this finding is consistent with current knowledge of the energetics of 
      the S0 to S4 reactions, and that the high exergonicity is required for the kinetic 
      efficiency of PSII.

TI  - Cato Guldberg and Peter Waage, the history of the Law of Mass Action, and its 
      relevance to clinical pharmacology.
PG  - 52-5
LID - 10.1111/bcp.12721 [doi]
AB  - We have traced the historical link between the Law of Mass Action and clinical 
      pharmacology. The Law evolved from the work of the French chemist Claude Louis 
      Berthollet, was first formulated by Cato Guldberg and Peter Waage in 1864 and later 
      clarified by the Dutch chemist Jacobus van 't Hoff in 1877. It has profoundly 
      influenced our qualitative and quantitative understanding of a number of 
      physiological and pharmacological phenomena. According to the Law of Mass Action, 
      the velocity of a chemical reaction depends on the concentrations of the reactants. 
      At equilibrium the concentrations of the chemicals involved bear a constant relation 
      to each other, described by the equilibrium constant, K. The Law of Mass Action is 
      relevant to various physiological and pharmacological concepts, including 
      concentration-effect curves, dose-response curves, and ligand-receptor binding 
      curves, all of which are important in describing the pharmacological actions of 
      medications, the Langmuir adsorption isotherm, which describes the binding of 
      medications to proteins, activation curves for transmembrane ion transport, enzyme 
      inhibition and the Henderson-Hasselbalch equation, which describes the relation 
      between pH, as a measure of acidity and the concentrations of the contributory acids 
      and bases. Guldberg and Waage recognized the importance of dynamic equilibrium, 
      while others failed to do so. Their ideas, over 150 years old, are embedded in and 
      still relevant to clinical pharmacology. Here we explain the ideas and in a 
      subsequent paper show how they are relevant to understanding adverse drug reactions.

AB  - Structural properties determine binding affinities of DNA aptamers specific to 
      thrombin. Our paper is the first to focus on a family of eight G-quadruplex-based 
      aptamers with varied duplex region length (from two to eight base pairs). We have 
      shown that the duplex, which is not the main binding domain, greatly influences the 
      interaction with thrombin and prothrombin. Furthermore, the affinity of an aptamer 
      to thrombin and prothrombin increases (respectively from 2.7×10⁻⁸ M to 5.6×10⁻¹⁰ M 
      and from 1.8×10⁻⁵ M to 7.1×10⁻⁹ M) with an increase in the number of nucleotide 
      pairs in the duplex region.

TI  - Distinct physiological strategies are used to cope with constant hypoxia and 
      intermittent hypoxia in killifish (Fundulus heteroclitus).
PG  - 1198-211
LID - 10.1242/jeb.114579 [doi]
AB  - Many fish encounter hypoxia on a daily cycle, but the physiological effects of 
      intermittent hypoxia are poorly understood. We investigated whether acclimation to 
      constant (sustained) hypoxia or to intermittent diel cycles of nocturnal hypoxia 
      (12 h normoxia:12 h hypoxia) had distinct effects on hypoxia tolerance or on several 
      determinants of O2 transport and O2 utilization in estuarine killifish. Adult 
      killifish were acclimated to normoxia, constant hypoxia, or intermittent hypoxia for 
      7 or 28 days in brackish water (4 ppt). Acclimation to both hypoxia patterns led to 
      comparable reductions in critical O2 tension and resting O2 consumption rate, but 
      only constant hypoxia reduced the O2 tension at loss of equilibrium. Constant (but 
      not intermittent) hypoxia decreased filament length and the proportion of 
      seawater-type mitochondrion-rich cells in the gills (which may reduce ion loss and 
      the associated costs of active ion uptake), increased blood haemoglobin content, and 
      reduced the abundance of oxidative fibres in the swimming muscle. In contrast, only 
      intermittent hypoxia augmented the oxidative and gluconeogenic enzyme activities in 
      the liver and increased the capillarity of glycolytic muscle, each of which should 
      facilitate recovery between hypoxia bouts. Neither exposure pattern affected muscle 
      myoglobin content or the activities of metabolic enzymes in the brain or heart, but 
      intermittent hypoxia increased brain mass. We conclude that the pattern of hypoxia 
      exposure has an important influence on the mechanisms of acclimation, and that the 
      optimal strategies used to cope with intermittent hypoxia may be distinct from those 
      for coping with constant hypoxia.

TI  - Omecamtiv Mecarbil modulates the kinetic and motile properties of porcine β-cardiac 
      myosin.
PG  - 1963-75
LID - 10.1021/bi5015166 [doi]
AB  - We determined the effect of Omecamtiv Mecarbil, a novel allosteric effector of 
      cardiac muscle myosin, on the kinetic and "in vitro" motility properties of the 
      porcine ventricular heavy meromyosin (PV-HMM). Omecamtiv Mecarbil increases the 
      equilibrium constant of the hydrolysis step (M-ATP ⇄ M-ADP-Pi) from 2.4 to 6 as 
      determined by quench flow, but the maximal rates of both the hydrolysis step and 
      tryptophan fluorescence increase are unchanged by the drug. OM also increases the 
      amplitude of the fast phase of phosphate dissociation (AM-ADP-Pi → AM-ADP + Pi) that 
      is associated with force production in muscle by 4-fold. These results suggest a 
      mechanism in which hydrolysis of M-ATP to M-ADP-Pi occurs both before and after the 
      recovery stroke, but rapid acceleration of phosphate dissociation by actin occurs 
      only on post-recovery stroke A-M-ADP-Pi. One of the more dramatic effects of OM on 
      PV-HMM is a 14-fold decrease in the unloaded shortening velocity measured by the in 
      vitro motility assay. The increase in flux through phosphate dissociation and the 
      unchanged rate of ADP dissociation (AM-ADP → AM + ADP) by the drug produce a higher 
      duty ratio motor in which a larger fraction of myosin heads are strongly bound to 
      actin filaments. The increased internal load produced by a larger fraction of 
      strongly attached crossbridges explains the reduced rate of in vitro motility 
      velocity in the presence of OM and predicts that the drug will produce slower and 
      stronger contraction of cardiac muscle.

TI  - Using nonequilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM) for 
      simultaneous determination of concentration and equilibrium constant.
PG  - 3099-106
LID - 10.1021/acs.analchem.5b00171 [doi]
AB  - Nonequilibrium capillary electrophoresis of equilibrium mixtures (NECEEM) is a 
      versatile tool for studying affinity binding. Here we describe a NECEEM-based 
      approach for simultaneous determination of both the equilibrium constant, K(d), and 
      the unknown concentration of a binder that we call a target, T. In essence, NECEEM 
      is used to measure the unbound equilibrium fraction, R, for the binder with a known 
      concentration that we call a ligand, L. The first set of experiments is performed at 
      varying concentrations of T, prepared by serial dilution of the stock solution, but 
      at a constant concentration of L, which is as low as its reliable quantitation 
      allows. The value of R is plotted as a function of the dilution coefficient, and 
      dilution corresponding to R = 0.5 is determined. This dilution of T is used in the 
      second set of experiments in which the concentration of T is fixed but the 
      concentration of L is varied. The experimental dependence of R on the concentration 
      of L is fitted with a function describing their theoretical dependence. Both K(d) 
      and the concentration of T are used as fitting parameters, and their sought values 
      are determined as the ones that generate the best fit. We have fully validated this 
      approach in silico by using computer-simulated NECEEM electropherograms and then 
      applied it to experimental determination of the unknown concentration of MutS 
      protein and K(d) of its interactions with a DNA aptamer. The general approach 
      described here is applicable not only to NECEEM but also to any other method that 
      can determine a fraction of unbound molecules at equilibrium.

AB  - Small solutes are useful probes of large conformational changes in RNA 
      polymerase-promoter interactions and other biopolymer processes. In general, a large 
      effect of a solute on an equilibrium constant (or rate constant) indicates a large 
      change in water-accessible biopolymer surface area in the corresponding step (or 
      transition state), resulting from conformational changes, interface formation, or 
      both. Here, we describe nitrocellulose filter binding assays from series used to 
      determine the urea dependence of open complex formation and dissociation with 
      Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and phage λPR promoter DNA. Then, we describe the 
      subsequent data analysis and interpretation of these solute effects.

      kinetics.
PG  - 22-30
LID - 10.1002/bab.1349 [doi]
AB  - Antibodies with rapid reaction kinetics (high association and dissociation rates), 
      named reversible antibodies, are used to perform continuous monitoring of sensitive 
      disease biomarkers. In cases of acute myocardial infarction (AMI), continuous 
      monitoring and early diagnosis are important. Human myoglobin (Myo) is a useful 
      biomarker for AMI during the early stage after the onset of symptoms. In this study, 
      a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) specific to Myo was derived from an IgG 
      antibody that has rapid reaction kinetics. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      revealed that recombinant scFv exhibited 3.8-fold reduced affinity compared with the 
      parent IgG antibody based on the antibody concentration necessary for 50% of the 
      maximum signal. The scFv retained the rapid reaction kinetic mode with average kon 
      and koff of 2.63 × 10(5) M(-1) Sec(-1) and 3.25 × 10(-3) Sec(-1) , respectively, 
      which were reduced to 10- and 2.3-fold compared with those of the parent antibody. 
      The equilibrium constant for the association of the scFv (KA = 8.09 × 10(7) M(-1) ) 
      was 4.6-fold lower than that of its parent IgG antibody. This scFv may be a starting 
      point for further mutagenesis/kinetic and structural analyses providing valuable 
      insight into the mechanism of reversible antibodies.

TI  - Insights into substrate binding to the oxygen-evolving complex of photosystem II 
      from ammonia inhibition studies.
PG  - 622-8
LID - 10.1021/bi5014134 [doi]
AB  - Water oxidation in Photosystem II occurs at the oxygen-evolving complex (OEC), which 
      cycles through distinct intermediates, S0-S4. The inhibitor ammonia selectively 
      binds to the S2 state at an unresolved site that is not competitive with substrate 
      water. By monitoring the yields of flash-induced oxygen production, we show that 
      ammonia decreases the net efficiency of OEC turnover and slows the decay kinetics of 
      S2 to S1. The temperature dependence of biphasic S2 decay kinetics provides 
      activation energies that do not vary in control and ammonia conditions. We interpret 
      our data in the broader context of previous studies by introducing a kinetic model 
      for both the formation and decay of ammonia-bound S2. The model predicts ammonia 
      binds to S2 rapidly (t1/2 = 1 ms) with a large equilibrium constant. This finding 
      implies that ammonia decreases the reduction potential of S2 by at least 2.7 kcal 
      mol(-1) (>120 mV), which is not consistent with ammonia substitution of a terminal 
      water ligand of Mn(IV). Instead, these data support the proposal that ammonia binds 
      as a bridging ligand between two Mn atoms. Implications for the mechanism of O-O 
      bond formation are discussed.

TI  - Effects of pH on the association between the inhibitor cystatin and the proteinase 
      chymopapain.
PG  - 239-47
AB  - Cysteine proteinases are involved in many aspects of physiological regulation. In 
      humans, some cathepsins have shown another function in addition to their role as 
      lysosomal proteases in intracellular protein degradation; they have been implicated 
      in the pathogenesis of several heart and blood vessel diseases and in cancer 
      development. In this work, we present a fluorometric and computational study of the 
      binding of one representative plant cysteine proteinase, chymopapain, to one of the 
      most studied inhibitors of these proteinases: chicken cystatin. The binding 
      equilibrium constant, Kb, was determined in the pH range between 3.5 and 10.0, 
      revealing a maximum in the affinity at pH 9.0. We constructed an atomic model for 
      the chymopapain-cystatin dimer by docking the individual 3D protein structures; 
      subsequently, the model was refined using a 100 ns NPT molecular dynamics simulation 
      in explicit water. Upon scrutiny of this model, we identified 14 ionizing residues 
      at the interface of the complex using a cutoff distance of 5.0 Å. Using the pKa 
      values predicted with PROPKA and a modified proton-linkage model, we performed a 
      regression analysis on our data to obtain the composite pKavalues for three 
      isoacidic residues. We also calculated the electrostatic component of the binding 
      energy (ΔGb,elec) at different pH values using an implicit solvent model and APBS 
      software. The pH profile of this calculated energy compares well with the 
      experimentally obtained binding energy, ΔGb. We propose that the residues that form 
      an interchain ionic pair, Lys139A from chymopapain and Glu19B from cystatin, as well 
      as Tyr61A and Tyr67A from chymopapain are the main residues responsible for the 
      observed pH dependence in the chymopapain- cystatin affinity.

TI  - Interactions of urea with native and unfolded proteins: a volumetric study.
PG  - 13554-63
LID - 10.1021/jp509356k [doi]
AB  - We describe a statistical thermodynamic approach to analyzing urea-dependent 
      volumetric properties of proteins. We use this approach to analyze our 
      urea-dependent data on the partial molar volume and adiabatic compressibility of 
      lysozyme, apocytochrome c, ribonuclease A, and α-chymotrypsinogen A. The analysis 
      produces the thermodynamic properties of elementary urea-protein association 
      reactions while also yielding estimates of the effective solvent-accessible surface 
      areas of the native and unfolded protein states. Lysozyme and apocytochrome c do not 
      undergo urea-induced transitions. The former remains folded, while the latter is 
      unfolded between 0 and 8 M urea. In contrast, ribonuclease A and α-chymotrypsinogen 
      A exhibit urea-induced unfolding transitions. Thus, our data permit us to 
      characterize urea-protein interactions in both the native and unfolded states. We 
      interpreted the urea-dependent volumetric properties of the proteins in terms of the 
      equilibrium constant, k, and changes in volume, ΔV0, and compressibility, ΔKT0, for 
      a reaction in which urea binds to a protein with a concomitant release of two waters 
      of hydration to the bulk. Comparison of the values of k, ΔV0, and ΔKT0 with the 
      similar data obtained on small molecules mimicking protein groups reveals lack of 
      cooperative effects involved in urea-protein interactions. In general, the 
      volumetric approach, while providing a unique characterization of cosolvent-protein 
      interactions, offers a practical way for evaluating the effective solvent accessible 
      surface area of biologically significant fully or partially unfolded polypeptides.

TI  - Reversibly locked thionucleobase pairs in DNA to study base flipping enzymes.
PG  - 2293-306
LID - 10.3762/bjoc.10.239 [doi]
AB  - Covalently interstrand cross-linked DNA is an interesting tool to study DNA binding 
      proteins that locally open up the DNA duplex by flipping single bases out of the DNA 
      helix or melting whole stretches of base pairs to perform their function. The ideal 
      DNA cross-link to study protein-DNA interactions should be specific and easy to 
      synthesize, be stable during protein binding experiments, have a short covalent 
      linker to avoid steric hindrance of protein binding, and should be available as a 
      mimic for both A/T and G/C base pairs to cover all possible binding specificities. 
      Several covalent interstrand cross-links have been described in the literature, but 
      most of them fall short of at least one of the above criteria. We developed an 
      efficient method to site-specifically and reversibly cross-link thionucleoside base 
      pairs in synthetic duplex oligodeoxynucleotides by bisalkylation with 
      1,2-diiodoethane resulting in an ethylene-bridged base pair. Both linked A/T and G/C 
      base pair analogs can conveniently be prepared which allows studying any base 
      pair-opening enzyme regardless of its sequence specificity. The cross-link is stable 
      in the absence of reducing agents but the linker can be quickly and tracelessly 
      removed by the addition of thiol reagents like dithiothreitol. This property makes 
      the cross-linking reaction fully reversible and allows for a switching of the linked 
      base pair from locked to unlocked during biochemical experiments. Using the DNA 
      methyltransferase from Thermus aquaticus (M.TaqI) as example, we demonstrate that 
      the presented cross-linked DNA with an ethylene-linked A/T base pair analog at the 
      target position is a useful tool to determine the base-flipping equilibrium constant 
      of a base-flipping enzyme which lies mostly on the extrahelical side for M.TaqI.

TI  - Surface plasmon resonance enhanced real-time photoelectrochemical protein sensing by 
      gold nanoparticle-decorated TiO₂ nanowires.
PG  - 6633-9

AB  - Recently developed photoelectrochemical (PEC) sensing systems represent a unique 
      potential detection method for real-time analysis of chemical/biological molecules, 
      while the low absorption of TiO2 nanomaterials in the visible wavelength region and 
      the slow surface charge transfer efficiency limit the ultimate sensitivity. Here we 
      develop a gold nanoparticle-decorated TiO2 nanowire sensor for PEC detection of 
      protein binding. The direct attachment of Au nanoparticles to TiO2 nanowires offers 
      strong surface plasmon resonance for electrochemical field effect amplification, 
      yielding a ~100% increase of photocurrent density. In addition, the surface 
      functionalization of gold nanoparticles allows for direct capturing of target 
      proteins near the Au/TiO2 interface and thus substantially enhances the capability 
      of attenuation of energy coupling between Au and TiO2, leading to much-improved 
      sensor performance. As a proof of concept, cholera toxin subunit B has been robustly 
      detected by the TiO2-Au nanowire sensor functionalized with ganglioside GM1, with a 
      high sensitivity of 0.167 nM and excellent selectivity. Furthermore, the real-time 
      feature of photoelectrochemical sensing enables direct measurement of binding 
      kinetics between cholera toxin subunit B and GM1, yielding association and 
      disassociation rate constants and an equilibrium constant K(d) of 4.17 nM. This 
      surface plasmon resonance-enhanced real-time, photoelectrochemical sensing design 
      may lead to exciting biodetection capabilities with high sensitivity and real-time 
      kinetic studies.

TI  - Efficiency of incorporation and chain termination determines the inhibition potency 
      of 2'-modified nucleotide analogs against hepatitis C virus polymerase.
PG  - 3636-45
LID - 10.1128/AAC.02666-14 [doi]
AB  - Ribonucleotide analog inhibitors of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of hepatitis C 
      virus (HCV) represent one of the most exciting recent developments in HCV antiviral 
      therapy. Although it is well established that these molecules cause chain 
      termination by competing at the triphosphate level with natural nucleotides for 
      incorporation into elongating RNA, strategies to rationally optimize antiviral 
      potency based on enzyme kinetics remain elusive. In this study, we used the isolated 
      HCV polymerase elongation complex to determine the pre-steady-state kinetics of 
      incorporation of 2'F-2'C-Me-UTP, the active metabolite of the anti-HCV drug 
      sofosbuvir. 2'F-2'C-Me-UTP was efficiently incorporated by HCV polymerase with 
      apparent Kd (equilibrium constant) and kpol (rate of nucleotide incorporation at 
      saturating nucleotide concentration) values of 113 ± 28 μM and 0.67 ± 0.05 s(-1), 
      respectively, giving an overall substrate efficiency (kpol/Kd) of 0.0059 ± 0.0015 
      μM(-1) s(-1). We also measured the substrate efficiency of other UTP analogs and 
      found that substitutions at the 2' position on the ribose can greatly affect their 
      level of incorporation, with a rank order of OH > F > NH2 > F-C-Me > C-Me > N3 > 
      ara. However, the efficiency of chain termination following the incorporation of UMP 
      analogs followed a different order, with only 2'F-2'C-Me-, 2'C-Me-, and 2'ara-UTP 
      causing complete and immediate chain termination. The chain termination profile of 
      the 2'-modified nucleotides explains the apparent lack of correlation observed 
      across all molecules between substrate efficiency at the single-nucleotide level and 
      their overall inhibition potency. To our knowledge, these results provide the first 
      attempt to use pre-steady-state kinetics to uncover the mechanism of action of 
      2'-modified NTP analogs against HCV polymerase.

      matrix metalloproteinases.
PG  - 4345-50
LID - 10.1021/jp501674b [doi]
AB  - We modeled the first steps of hydrolysis reactions of a natural oligopeptide 
      substrate of matrix metalloproteinase MMP-2 as well as of a substrate analogue. In 
      the latter, the scissile amide group is substituted by a ketomethylene group which 
      can be transformed to the ketal group upon binding of this compound to the enzyme 
      active site. According to our quantum mechanical-molecular mechanical (QM/MM) 
      calculations, the reaction of the ketone-ketal transformation proceeds with a low 
      energy barrier (3.4 kcal/mol) and a high equilibrium constant (10(4)). The reaction 
      product with the ketal group formed directly at the active site of the enzyme works 
      as an inhibitor that chelates the zinc ion. On the other hand, the oligopeptide 
      mimetic retains molecular groups responsible for binding of this compound to the 
      enzyme active site. This example illustrates a strategy to design MMP inhibitors in 
      situ by using data on binding specificity of substrates to a particular type of MMP 
      and details of the reaction mechanism.

LID - 10.1002/jssc.201301007 [doi]
AB  - The separation of proteins by internally and externally generated pH gradients in 
      chromatofocusing on ion-exchange columns is a well-established analytical method 
      with a large number of applications. In this work, a stoichiometric displacement 
      model was used to describe the retention behavior of lysozyme on SP Sepharose FF and 
      a monoclonal antibody on Fractogel SO3 (S) in linear salt and pH gradient elution. 
      The pH dependence of the binding charge B in the linear gradient elution model is 
      introduced using a protein net charge model, while the pH dependence of the 
      equilibrium constant is based on a thermodynamic approach. The model parameter and 
      pH dependences are calculated from linear salt gradient elutions at different pH 
      values as well as from linear pH gradient elutions at different fixed salt 
      concentrations. The application of the model for the well-characterized protein 
      lysozyme resulted in almost identical model parameters based on either linear salt 
      or pH gradient elution data. For the antibody, only the approach based on linear pH 
      gradients is feasible because of the limited pH range useful for salt gradient 
      elution. The application of the model for the separation of an acid variant of the 
      antibody from the major monomeric form is discussed.

PG  - 508-13
LID - 10.1016/j.redox.2013.10.005 [doi]
AB  - Glutathione is present in millimolar concentrations in the cell, but its relative 
      distribution among cellular compartments remains elusive. We have chosen the 
      endoplasmic reticulum (ER) as an example organelle to study compartment-specific 
      glutathione levels. Using a glutaredoxin sensor (sCGrx1pER), which rapidly and 
      specifically equilibrates with the reduced glutathione (GSH)-glutathione disulfide 
      (GSSG) redox couple with known equilibrium constant, we showed that the [GSH]:[GSSG] 
      ratio in the ER of intact HeLa cells is less than 7:1. Taking into consideration the 
      previously determined value for [GSH](2):[GSSG] in the ER of 83 mM, this translates 
      into a total glutathione concentration in the ER ([GStot]=[GSH]+2[GSSG]) of greater 
      than 15 mM. Since the integrated, intracellular [GStot] was measured as ~7 mM, we 
      conclude the existence of a [GStot] gradient across the ER membrane. A possible 
      homeostatic mechanism by which cytosol-derived glutathione is trapped in the ER is 
      discussed. We propose a high [GStot] as a distinguishing feature of the ER 
      environment compared to the extracellular space.

AB  - Better understanding of the interaction between nanoparticles (NPs) and protein is 
      the basis for biological and biomedical applications of NPs. Water-soluble 
      fluorescent CdS NPs have been widely used in the biological and biomedical fields 
      and the study on effect of CdS NPs size on conformation and enzymatic activity of 
      protein might be very important in its application. In this work, the interaction of 
      CdS NPs with different size with type II restriction endonuclease (EcoRI) were 
      investigated by atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, UV-vis 
      spectroscopy, fluorescence quenching method, CD spectra, laser scanning confocal 
      microscopy and gel electrophoresis. It was found that the equilibrium constant (kD) 
      as well as the cooperativity degree of CdS NPs-EcoRI binding (Hill constant, n) 
      strongly depended on the CdS NPs size. The different curvature of CdS NPs surface 
      could result in different changes of EcoRI conformation. The gel electrophoresis 
      indicated that the decrease in α-helix content more or less affected the activity of 
      EcoRI.

TI  - Electrochemical behavior of flavin adenine dinucleotide adsorbed onto carbon 
      nanotube and nitrogen-doped carbon nanotube electrodes.
PG  - 13605-13
LID - 10.1021/la403020y [doi]
AB  - Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) is a cofactor for many enzymes, but also an 
      informative redox active surface probe for electrode materials such as carbon 
      nanotubes (CNTs) and nitrogen-doped CNTs (N-CNTs). FAD spontaneously adsorbs onto 
      the surface of CNTs and N-CNTs, displaying Langmuir adsorption characteristics. The 
      Langmuir adsorption model provides a means of calculating the electroactive surface 
      area (ESA), the equilibrium constant for the adsorption and desorption processes 
      (K), and the Gibbs free energy of adsorption (ΔG°). Traditional ESA measurements 
      based on the diffusional flux of a redox active molecule to the electrode surface 
      underestimate the ESA of porous materials because pores are not penetrated. 
      Techniques such as gas adsortion (BET) overestimate the ESA because it includes both 
      electroactive and inactive areas. The ESA determined by extrapolation of the 
      Langmuir adsorption model with the electroactive surface probe FAD will penetrate 
      pores and only include electroactive areas. The redox activity of adsorbed FAD also 
      displays a strong dependency on pH, which provides a means of determining the pKa of 
      the surface confined species. The pKa of FAD decreases as the nitrogen content in 
      the CNTs increases, suggesting a decreased hydrophobicity of the N-CNT surface. FAD 
      desorption at N-CNTs slowly transforms the main FAD surface redox reaction with E1/2 
      at -0.84 V into two new, reversible, surface confined redox reactions with E1/2 at 
      -0.65 and -0.76 V (vs Hg/Hg2SO4), respectively (1.0 M sodium phosphate buffer pH = 
      6.75). This is the first time these redox reactions have been observed. The new 
      surface confined redox reactions were not observed during FAD desorption from 
      nondoped CNTs.

TI  - Specific heat of hydrated lysozyme, water's contribution to its dynamics, and 
      criteria for glass formation of biomaterials.
PG  - 105102
LID - 10.1063/1.4819791 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies of the dynamics of hydrated proteins had shown a feature resembling 
      an exceptionally broad glass-softening endotherm. Its onset temperature, denoted as 
      T(g), was indefinable in one calorimetric study of hydrated lysozyme and was in the 
      148-218 K range in another study, depending upon hydration. Other methods reported 
      this T(g) as ~170 K. We argue that glass-formation of biomaterials should be studied 
      by measuring a property on both the cooling and heating paths and it should be 
      ascertained (i) that there is thermal hysteresis of the measured property, (ii) that 
      the real and imaginary components of a dynamic property obey the Kramers-Kronig 
      relations, and (iii) that there is an effect of annealing that is consistent with 
      the glass phenomenology. We report the real and imaginary components of the dynamic 
      specific heat, C(p)' and C(p)", of dry and two hydrated lysozyme samples on the 
      cooling and the heating paths as well as the effects of annealing and changing the 
      frequency. For the most hydrated (34.6 g water per 100 g lysozyme) sample, C(p,app) 
      does not show thermal hysteresis in the 160-230 K range, C(p)' varies in a 
      sigmoid-shape manner with T while C(p)" remains close to zero, and there is no 
      effect of annealing. We interpret these findings in terms of continuous development 
      of ice-like aggregates of immobile H2O as more H-bonds form on cooling, and 
      continuous deterioration of the aggregates on heating. As the equilibrium constant 
      between the aggregates and mobile H2O increases on cooling, configurational degrees 
      of freedom of H2O molecules and lysozyme segments decrease. Consequently, the net 
      change in enthalpy is small but the change in C(p) is large. Mobility of the 
      lysozyme segments still depends upon the mobility of H2O molecules.

TI  - Warfarin modulates the nitrite reductase activity of ferrous human serum 
      heme-albumin.
PG  - 939-46
LID - 10.1007/s00775-013-1040-2 [doi]
AB  - Human serum heme-albumin (HSA-heme-Fe) displays reactivity and spectroscopic 
      properties similar to those of heme proteins. Here, the nitrite reductase activity 
      of ferrous HSA-heme-Fe [HSA-heme-Fe(II)] is reported. The value of the second-order 
      rate constant for the reduction of [Formula: see text] to NO and the concomitant 
      formation of nitrosylated HSA-heme-Fe(II) (i.e., k on) is 1.3 M(-1) s(-1) at pH 7.4 
      and 20 °C. Values of k on increase by about one order of magnitude for each pH unit 
      decrease between pH 6.5 to 8.2, indicating that the reaction requires one proton. 
      Warfarin inhibits the HSA-heme-Fe(II) reductase activity, highlighting the 
      allosteric linkage between the heme binding site [also named the fatty acid (FA) 
      binding site 1; FA1] and the drug-binding cleft FA2. The dissociation equilibrium 
      constant for warfarin binding to HSA-heme-Fe(II) is (3.1 ± 0.4) × 10(-4) M at pH 7.4 
      and 20 °C. These results: (1) represent the first evidence for the [Formula: see 
      text] reductase activity of HSA-heme-Fe(II), (2) highlight the role of drugs (e.g., 
      warfarin) in modulating HSA(-heme-Fe) functions, and (3) strongly support the view 
      that HSA acts not only as a heme carrier but also displays transient heme-based 
      reactivity.

AB  - Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a key regulator of pathological 
      angiogenesis and vascular permeability and overexpressed by most solid tumors. VEGF 
      receptor-2 (VEGFR-2 or kinase-insert domain-containing receptor as it is called in 
      human, KDR) is a specific receptor of VEGF with a high binding affinity. A solube 
      recombinant extracellular domain 1-3 of human VEGFR-2 (rKDR1-3) was expressed in 
      Escherichia coli (E. Coli) and purified from the bacterial periplasmic extracts by 
      immobilized metal affinity chromatography and anion exchange chromatography to 
      inhibit the VEGF-induced angiogenesis. A surface plasmon resonance (SPR) technology 
      was adopted to analyze the affinity and kinetics constant between rKDR1-3 and 
      VEGF165. Under the given experimental conditions, the association rate constant Ka 
      was 1.06×10(5)M(-1) S(-1), the dissociation rate Kd was 6.09×10(-3) S(-1), the 
      dissociation constant KD was 5.74×10(-8)M. The effect of rKDR1-3 on VEGF-induced 
      endothelial cell proliferation was studied using MTT assay, scratch-wound healing 
      assay and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) assay. The results showed that rKDR1-3 
      could inhibit neovascularization and serve as a useful drug candidate in research, 
      diagnostics and therapy of cancer.

AB  - Protein partner exchange plays a key role in regulating many biological switches. 
      Although widespread, the mechanisms dictating protein partner identity and, 
      therefore, the outcome of a switch have been determined for a limited number of 
      systems. The Escherichia coli protein BirA undergoes a switch between 
      posttranslational biotin attachment and transcription repression in response to 
      cellular biotin demand. Moreover, the functional switch reflects formation of 
      alternative mutually exclusive protein:protein interactions by BirA. Previous 
      studies provided a set of alanine-substituted BirA variants with altered kinetic and 
      equilibrium parameters of forming these interactions. In this work, DNase I 
      footprinting measurements were employed to investigate the consequences of these 
      altered properties for the outcome of the BirA functional switch. The results 
      support a mechanism in which BirA availability for DNA binding and, therefore, 
      transcription repression is controlled by the rate of the competing protein:protein 
      interaction. However, occupancy of the transcriptional regulatory site on DNA by 
      BirA is exquisitely tuned by the equilibrium constant governing its 
      homodimerization.

AB  - Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is an essential structural component found in Gram-negative 
      bacteria. The molecule is comprised of a highly conserved lipid A and a variable 
      outer core consisting of various sugars. LPS plays important roles in membrane 
      stability in the bacterial cell and is also a potent activator of the human immune 
      system. Despite its obvious importance, little is understood regarding the 
      regulation of the individual enzymes involved or the pathway as a whole. LpxA and 
      LpxC catalyze the first two steps in the LPS pathway. The reaction catalyzed by LpxA 
      possesses a highly unfavourable equilibrium constant with no evidence of coupling to 
      an energetically favourable reaction. In our model the presence of the second enzyme 
      LpxC was sufficient to abate this unfavourable reaction and confirming previous 
      studies suggesting that this reaction is the first committed step in LPS synthesis. 
      It is believed that the protease FtsH regulates LpxC activity via cleavage. It is 
      also suspected that the activity of FtsH is regulated by a metabolite produced by 
      the LPS pathway; however, it is not known which one. In order to investigate these 
      mechanisms, we obtained kinetic parameters from literature and developed estimates 
      for other simulation parameters. Our simulations suggest that under modest increases 
      in LpxC activity, FtsH is able to regulate the rate of product formation. However, 
      under extreme increases in LpxC activities such as over-expression or asymmetrical 
      cell division then FtsH activation may not be sufficient to regulate this first 
      stage of synthesis.

AB  - The interaction of mitoxantrone with d-(CTCGAG)2 has been studied by absorption, 
      fluorescence and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy. The hypochromism and 
      quenching of fluorescence showed that about four mitoxantrone molecules may be 
      binding externally to DNA hexamer sequence at high drug to nucleic (D/N) acid duplex 
      ratios (28.0-1.1). At lower D/N ratios (1.0-0.2), a red shift in absorption maxima 
      at 610 and 660 nm by 15 and 20 nm, respectively and a red shift in emission maxima 
      by 11 nm accompanied by increase in absorbance and emission has been observed. The 
      equilibrium constant for binding at low (1.0-0.2) and high (28.0-1.1) D/N ratios is 
      1.8×10(5) M(-1) and 1.38×10(6) M(-1), respectively. The CD spectra show change in 
      intensity of bands accompanied by appearance of induced bands at 325 nm and 650-700 
      nm. The 251 nm band shows blue shift at D/N ratio of 0.25 and 0.5. The binding 
      isotherms show stoichiometry of 0.25 and 0.5 mitoxantrone molecules binding per 
      duplex. The results suggest stacking of aromatic chromophore of mitoxantrone with 
      terminal base pair of DNA strand forming a sandwiched structure of mitoxantrone 
      between four and two duplex molecules. These investigations are relevant to the 
      formation of ternary complex with topoisomerase enzyme and hence an understanding of 
      anti tumor action of mitoxantrone.

TI  - Measuring and modeling the kinetics of individual DNA-DNA polymerase complexes on a 
      nanopore.
PG  - 3876-86
LID - 10.1021/nn401180j [doi]
AB  - The assembly of a DNA-DNA polymerase binary complex is the precursory step in genome 
      replication, in which the enzyme binds to the 3' junction created when a primer 
      binds to its complementary substrate. In this study, we use an active control method 
      for observing the binding interaction between Klenow fragment (exo-) (KF) in the 
      bulk-phase chamber above an α-hemolysin (α-HL) nanopore and a single DNA molecule 
      tethered noncovalently in the nanopore. Specifically, the control method regulates 
      the temporal availability of the primer-template DNA to KF binding and unbinding 
      above the nanopore, on millisecond-to-second time scales. Our nanopore measurements 
      support a model that incorporates two mutually exclusive binding states of KF to DNA 
      at the primer-template junction site, termed "weakly bound" and "strongly bound" 
      states. The composite binding affinity constant, the equilibrium constant between 
      the weak and strong states, and the unbound-to-strong association rate are 
      quantified from the data using derived modeling analysis. The results support that 
      the strong state is in the nucleotide incorporation pathway, consistent with other 
      nanopore assays. Surprisingly, the measured unbound-to-strong association process 
      does not fit a model that admits binding of only free (unbound) KF to the tethered 
      DNA but does fit an association rate that is proportional to the total (unbound and 
      DNA-bound) KF concentration in the chamber above the nanopore. Our method provides a 
      tool for measuring pre-equilibrium kinetics one molecule at a time, serially and for 
      tens of thousands of single-molecule events, and can be used for other 
      polynucleotide-binding enzymes.

TI  - Kinetics of endophilin N-BAR domain dimerization and membrane interactions.
PG  - 12533-43
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.435511 [doi]
AB  - The recruitment to plasma membrane invaginations of the protein endophilin is a 
      temporally regulated step in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. Endophilin is believed 
      to sense or stabilize membrane curvature, which in turn likely depends on the 
      dimeric structure of the protein. The dynamic nature of the membrane association and 
      dimerization of endophilin is thus functionally important and is illuminated herein. 
      Using subunit exchange Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET), we determine dimer 
      dissociation kinetics and find a dimerization equilibrium constant orders of 
      magnitude lower than previously published values. We characterize N-BAR domain 
      membrane association kinetics under conditions where the dimeric species 
      predominates, by stopped flow, observing prominent electrostatic sensitivity of 
      membrane interaction kinetics. Relative to membrane binding, we find that protein 
      monomer/dimer species equilibrate with far slower kinetics. Complementary optical 
      microscopy studies reveal strikingly slow membrane dissociation and an increase of 
      dissociation rate constant for a construct lacking the amphipathic segment helix 0 
      (H0). We attribute the slow dissociation kinetics to higher-order protein 
      oligomerization on the membrane. We incorporate our findings into a kinetic scheme 
      for endophilin N-BAR membrane binding and find a significant separation of time 
      scales for endophilin membrane binding and subsequent oligomerization. This 
      separation may facilitate the regulation of membrane trafficking phenomena.

LID - 10.1021/jp4006923 [doi]
AB  - An assay for the determination of the equilibrium constant for heteroassociation of 
      α-chymotrypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor via fluorescence depolarization is 
      described. Results obtained at neutral pH in saline buffer were consistent with 
      prior determinations via sedimentation equilibrium and static light scattering. The 
      dependence of the association equilibrium constant upon the concentrations of urea 
      and trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO) added individually and in mixtures was determined 
      at several temperatures. It was found that subdenaturing concentrations of urea 
      decrease the extent of heteroassociation and that added TMAO increases the extent of 
      heteroassociation. The effects of both cosolutes in mixtures upon the equilibrium 
      heteroassociation of α-chymotrypsin and soybean trypsin inhibitor appear to be 
      additive. A thermodynamic analysis of the combined results is presented.

AB  - Tricin was evaluated as a type of tyrosinase inhibitor with good efficacy compared 
      to arbutin. Tricin functioned as a non-competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, with an 
      equilibrium constant of 2.30 mmol/L. The molecular mechanisms underlying the 
      inhibition of tyrosinase by tricin were investigated by means of circular dichroism 
      spectra, fluorescence quenching and molecular docking. These assays demonstrated 
      that the interactions between tricin and tyrosinase did not change the secondary 
      structure. The interaction of tricin with residues in the hydrophobic pocket of 
      tyrosinase was revealed by fluorescence quenching; the complex was stabilized by 
      hydrophobic associations and hydrogen bonding (with residues Asn80 and Arg267). 
      Docking results implied that the possible inhibitory mechanisms may be attributed to 
      the stereospecific blockade effects of tricin on substrates or products and flexible

TI  - Characterization of the yeast actin patch protein App1p phosphatidate phosphatase.
PG  - 6427-37
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M112.449629 [doi]
AB  - Yeast App1p is a phosphatidate phosphatase (PAP) that associates with endocytic 
      proteins at cortical actin patches. App1p, which catalyzes the conversion of 
      phosphatidate (PA) to diacylglycerol, is unique among Mg(2+)-dependent PAP enzymes 
      in that its reaction is not involved with de novo lipid synthesis. Instead, App1p 
      PAP is thought to play a role in endocytosis because its substrate and product 
      facilitate membrane fission/fusion events and regulate enzymes that govern vesicular 
      movement. App1p PAP was purified from yeast and characterized with respect to its 
      enzymological, kinetic, and regulatory properties. Maximum PAP activity was 
      dependent on Triton X-100 (20 mm), PA (2 mm), Mg(2+) (0.5 mm), and 2-mercaptoethanol 
      (10 mm) at pH 7.5 and 30 °C. Analysis of surface dilution kinetics with Triton 
      X-100/PA-mixed micelles yielded constants for surface binding (Ks(A) = 11 mm), 
      interfacial PA binding (Km(B) = 4.2 mol %), and catalytic efficiency (Vmax = 557 
      μmol/min/mg). The activation energy, turnover number, and equilibrium constant were 
      16.5 kcal/mol, 406 s(-1), and 16.2, respectively. PAP activity was stimulated by 
      anionic lipids (cardiolipin, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylserine, and 
      CDP-diacylglycerol) and inhibited by zwitterionic (phosphatidylcholine and 
      phosphatidylethanolamine) and cationic (sphinganine) lipids, nucleotides (ATP and 
      CTP), N-ethylmaleimide, propranolol, phenylglyoxal, and divalent cations (Ca(2+), 
      Mn(2+), and Zn(2+)). App1p also utilized diacylglycerol pyrophosphate and lyso-PA as 
      substrates with specificity constants 4- and 7-fold lower, respectively, when 
      compared with PA.

TI  - The effect of Ca(2+) ions and ionic strength on Mn(II) oxidation by spores of the 
      marine Bacillus sp. SG-1.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1016/j.gca.2012.10.008 [doi]
AB  - Manganese(IV) oxides, believed to form primarily through microbial activities, are 
      extremely important mineral phases in marine environments where they scavenge a 
      variety of trace elements and thereby control their distributions. The presence of 
      various ions common in seawater are known to influence Mn oxide mineralogy yet 
      little is known about the effect of these ions on the kinetics of bacterial Mn(II) 
      oxidation and Mn oxide formation. We examined factors affecting bacterial Mn(II) 
      oxidation by spores of the marine Bacillus sp. strain SG-1 in natural and artificial 
      seawater of varying ionic conditions. Ca(2+) concentration dramatically affected 
      Mn(II) oxidation, while Mg(2+), Sr(2+), K(+), Na(+) and NO(3)(-) ions had no effect. 
      The rate of Mn(II) oxidation at 10mM Ca(2+) (seawater composition) was four or five 
      times that without Ca(2+). The relationship between Ca(2+) content and oxidation 
      rate demonstrates that the equilibrium constant is small (on the order of 0.1) and 
      the binding coefficient is 0.5. The pH optimum for Mn(II) oxidation changed 
      depending on the amount of Ca(2+) present, suggesting that Ca(2+) exerts a direct 
      effect on the enzyme perhaps as a stabilizing bridge between polypeptide components. 
      We also examined the effect of varying concentrations of NaCl or KNO(3) (0 mM - 2000 
      mM) on the kinetics of Mn(II) oxidation in solutions containing 10 mM Ca(2+). Mn(II) 
      oxidation was unaffected by changes in ionic strength (I) below 0.2, but it was 
      inhibited by increasing salt concentrations above this value. Our results suggest 
      that the critical coagulation concentration is around 200 mM of salt (I = ca. 0.2), 
      and that the ionic strength of seawater (I > 0.2) accelerates the precipitation of 
      Mn oxides around the spores. Under these conditions, the aggregation of Mn oxides 
      reduces the supply of dissolved O(2) and/or Mn(2+) and inhibits the Mn(II) -> 
      Mn(III) step controlling the enzymatic oxidation of Mn(II). Our results suggest that 
      the hardness and ionic strength of the aquatic environment at circumneutral pH 
      strongly influences the rate of biologically mediated Mn(II) oxidation.

TI  - Regulation of glycogen synthase from mammalian skeletal muscle--a unifying view of 
      allosteric and covalent regulation.
PG  - 2-27
LID - 10.1111/febs.12059 [doi]
AB  - It is widely accepted that insufficient insulin-stimulated activation of muscle 
      glycogen synthesis is one of the major components of non-insulin-dependent (type 2) 
      diabetes mellitus. Glycogen synthase, a key enzyme in muscle glycogen synthesis, is 
      extensively regulated, both allosterically (by glucose-6-phosphate, ATP, and others) 
      and covalently (by phosphorylation). Although glycogen synthase has been a topic of 
      intense study for more than 50 years, its kinetic characterization has been 
      confounded by its large number of phosphorylation states. Questions remain regarding 
      the function of glycogen synthase regulation and the relative importance of 
      allosteric and covalent modification in fulfilling this function. In this review, we 
      consider both earlier kinetic studies and more recent site-directed mutagenesis and 
      crystal structure studies in a detailed qualitative discussion of the effects of 
      regulation on the kinetics of glycogen synthase. We propose that both allosteric and 
      covalent modification of glycogen synthase may be described by a 
      Monod-Wyman-Changeux model in terms of apparent changes to L, the equilibrium 
      constant for transition between the T and R conformers. As, with the exception of L, 
      all parameters of this model are independent of the glycogen synthase 
      phosphorylation state, the need to determine kinetic parameters for all possible 
      states is eliminated; only the relationship between a particular state and L must be 
      established. We conclude by suggesting that renewed efforts to characterize the 
      relationship between phosphorylation and the kinetics of glycogen synthase are 
      essential in order to obtain a better quantitative understanding of the function of 
      glycogen synthesis regulation. The model we propose may prove useful in this regard.

TI  - Cooperative regulation of myosin-S1 binding to actin filaments by a continuous 
      flexible Tm-Tn chain.
PG  - 1015-32
LID - 10.1007/s00249-012-0859-8 [doi]
AB  - The regulation of striated muscle contraction involves cooperative interactions 
      between actin filaments, myosin-S1 (S1), tropomyosin (Tm), troponin (Tn), and 
      calcium. These interactions are modeled by treating overlapping tropomyosins as a 
      continuous flexible chain (CFC), weakly confined by electrostatic interactions with 
      actin. The CFC is displaced locally in opposite directions on the actin surface by 
      the binding of either S1 or Troponin I (TnI) to actin. The apparent rate constants 
      for myosin and TnI binding to and detachment from actin are then intrinsically 
      coupled via the CFC model to the presence of neighboring bound S1s and TnIs. Monte 
      Carlo simulations at prescribed values of the CFC stiffness, the CFC's degree of 
      azimuthal confinement, and the angular displacements caused by the bound proteins 
      were able to predict the stopped-flow transients of S1 binding to regulated F-actin. 
      The transients collected over a large range of calcium concentrations could be well 
      described by adjusting a single calcium-dependent parameter, the rate constant of 
      TnI detachment from actin, k(-I). The resulting equilibrium constant K(B) ≡ 1/K(I) 
      varied sigmoidally with the free calcium, increasing from 0.12 at low calcium (pCa 
      >7) to 12 at high calcium (pCa <5.5) with a Hill coefficient of ~2.15. The 
      similarity of the curves for excess-actin and excess-myosin data confirms their 
      allosteric relationship. The spatially explicit calculations confirmed variable 
      sizes for the cooperative units and clustering of bound myosins at low calcium 
      concentrations. Moreover, inclusion of negative cooperativity between myosin units 
      predicted the observed slowing of myosin binding at excess-myosin concentrations.

AB  - Assembly of glutenin polymers was examined for two contrasted durum wheat cultivars 
      in connection with changes in the redox status of the endosperm cells that 
      accompanied grain development. The evolutions of the redox state of ascorbate and 
      glutathione, as well as the activities of antioxidant enzymes were measured. Changes 
      in the size distribution profile and redox state of storage proteins were evaluated, 
      with particular emphasis on protein-bound glutathione (PSSG). At the beginning of 
      grain filling phase, the size distribution profile of proteins included an extra 
      peak shoulder at about 40,000 g mol(-1). The shoulder was assimilated to free 
      glutenin subunits as it disappeared concomitantly with the upturn in glutenin 
      polymers accumulation. Irrespective of cultivars, small SDS-soluble polymers 
      accumulated first, followed by larger and insoluble ones, attesting for a 
      progressive polymerization. During the grain filling phase, catalase (EC 1.11.1.6) 
      activity dropped, reaching a very low level at physiological maturity. During the 
      same period, superoxide dismutase (EC 1.15.1.1) and glutathione reductase (EC 
      1.6.4.2) activities increased steadily while the equilibrium constant between GSSG 
      and PSSG shifted from 10(-2) to unity. These results demonstrated that grain filling 
      was accompanied by a continuous decrease in cellular redox potential. In this 
      context, formation of protein-bound glutathione would represent a protective 
      mechanism against irreversible thiol oxidation. Storage protein S-glutathionylation 
      instead of limiting glutenin polymer assembly as it has been proposed might be a 
      required intermediate step for glutenin subunits pairing.

TI  - Revisiting zinc coordination in human carbonic anhydrase II.
PG  - 11098-105
LID - 10.1021/ic301645j [doi]
AB  - Carbonic anhydrase (CA, general abbreviation for human carbonic anhydrase II) is a 
      well-studied, zinc-dependent metalloenzyme that catalyzes hydrolysis of carbon 
      dioxide to the bicarbonate ion. The apo-form of CA (apoCA, CA where Zn(2+) ion has 
      been removed) is relatively easy to generate, and reconstitution of the human 
      erythrocyte CA has been initially investigated. In the past, these studies have 
      continually relied on equilibrium dialysis measurements to ascertain an extremely 
      strong association constant (K(a) ≈ 1.2 × 10(12)) for Zn(2+). However, new 
      reactivity data and isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) data reported herein call 
      that number into question. As shown in the ITC experiments, the catalytic site binds 
      a stoichiometric quantity of Zn(2+) with a strong equilibrium constant (K(a) ≈ 2 × 
      10(9)) that is 3 orders of magnitude lower than the previously established value. 
      Thermodynamic parameters associated with Zn(2+) binding to apoCA are unraveled from 
      a series of complex equilibria associated with the in vitro metal binding event. 
      This in-depth analysis adds clarity to the complex ion chemistry associated with 
      zinc binding to carbonic anhydrase and validates thermochemical methods that 
      accurately measure association constants and thermodynamic parameters for 
      complex-ion and coordination chemistry observed in vitro. Additionally, the zinc 
      sites in both the as-isolated and the reconstituted ZnCA (active CA containing a 
      mononuclear Zn(2+) center) were probed using X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Both 
      X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine 
      structure (EXAFS) analyses indicate the zinc center in the reconstituted carbonic 
      anhydrase is nearly identical to that of the as-isolated protein and confirm the 
      notion that the metal binding data reported herein is the reconstitution of the zinc 
      active site of human CA II.

TI  - Modulation of a pre-existing conformational equilibrium tunes adenylate kinase 
      activity.
PG  - 16562-70
LID - 10.1021/ja3032482 [doi]
AB  - Structural plasticity is often required for distinct microscopic steps during 
      enzymatic reaction cycles. Adenylate kinase from Escherichia coli (AK(eco)) 
      populates two major conformations in solution; the open (inactive) and closed 
      (active) state, and the overall turnover rate is inversely proportional to the 
      lifetime of the active conformation. Therefore, structural plasticity is intimately 
      coupled to enzymatic turnover in AK(eco). Here, we probe the open to closed 
      conformational equilibrium in the absence of bound substrate with NMR spectroscopy 
      and molecular dynamics simulations. The conformational equilibrium in absence of 
      substrate and, in turn, the turnover number can be modulated with mutational- and 
      osmolyte-driven perturbations. Removal of one hydrogen bond between the ATP and AMP 
      binding subdomains results in a population shift toward the open conformation and a 
      resulting increase of k(cat). Addition of the osmolyte TMAO to AK(eco) results in 
      population shift toward the closed conformation and a significant reduction of 
      k(cat). The Michaelis constants (K(M)) scale with the change in k(cat), which 
      follows from the influence of the population of the closed conformation for 
      substrate binding affinity. Hence, k(cat) and K(M) are mutually dependent, and in 
      the case of AK(eco), any perturbation that modulates k(cat) is mirrored with a 
      proportional response in K(M). Thus, our results demonstrate that the equilibrium 
      constant of a pre-existing conformational equilibrium directly affects enzymatic 
      catalysis. From an evolutionary perspective, our findings suggest that, for AK(eco), 
      there exists ample flexibility to obtain a specificity constant (k(cat)/K(M)) that 
      commensurate with the exerted cellular selective pressure.

      titration calorimetry.

AB  - Homoprotocatechuate 2,3-dioxygenase (HPCD) is a member of the extradiol dioxygenase 
      family of non-heme iron enzymes. These enzymes catalyze the ring-cleavage step in 
      the aromatic degradation pathway commonly found in soil bacteria. In this study, 
      isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) is used to measure the equilibrium constant 
      (K = 1.1 ± 0.6 × 10(6)) and enthalpy change (ΔH = -17.0 ± 1.7 kcal/mol) associated 
      with homoprotocatechuate binding to HPCD. The ITC data are consistent with the 
      release of approximately 2.6 protons upon binding of the substrate to HPCD. These 
      results raise new questions regarding the relationships between substrate, protein, 
      and the oxygen activation mechanism for this class of non-heme metalloenzymes.

TI  - UDP-glucuronic acid binds first and the aglycone substrate binds second to form a 
      ternary complex in UGT1A9-catalyzed reactions, in both the presence and absence of 
      bovine serum albumin.
PG  - 2192-203
LID - 10.1124/dmd.112.047746 [doi]
AB  - The presence of bovine serum albumin (BSA) largely modulates the enzyme kinetics 
      parameters of the human UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A9, increasing both the 
      apparent aglycone substrate affinity of the enzyme and its limiting reaction 
      velocity (Drug Metab Dispos 39:2117-2129, 2011). For a better understanding of the 
      BSA effects and an examination of whether its presence changes the catalytic 
      mechanism, we have studied the enzyme kinetics of 4-methylumbelliferone 
      glucuronidation by UGT1A9 in the presence and absence of 0.1% BSA, using bisubstrate 
      enzyme kinetic experiments, in both the forward and reverse directions, as well as 
      product and dead-end inhibition. The combined results strongly suggest that the 
      reaction mechanism of UGT1A9, and presumably other human UGTs as well, involves the 
      formation of a compulsory-order ternary-complex, with UDP-α-d-glucuronic acid 
      (UDPGA) as the first binding substrate. Based on the enzyme kinetic parameters 
      measured for the forward and reverse reactions, the equilibrium constant of the 
      overall reaction was calculated (Keq = 574) and the relative magnitudes of the 
      reaction rate constants were elucidated. The inclusion of BSA in the bisubstrate 
      kinetic experiments quantitatively changed the apparent enzyme kinetic parameters, 
      presumably by removing internal inhibitors that bind to the binary enzyme-UDPGA 
      (E-UDPGA) complex, as well as to the ternary E-UDPGA-aglycone complex. Nevertheless, 
      the underlying compulsory-order ternary-complex mechanism with UDPGA binding first 
      is the same in both the absence and presence of BSA. The results offer a novel 
      understanding of UGT enzyme kinetic mechanism and BSA effects.

AB  - The combination of optimized and passivated Field Effect Transistors (FETs) based on 
      carbon nanotubes (CNTs) together with the appropriate choice and immobilization 
      strategy of aptamer receptors and buffer concentration have allowed the highly 
      sensitive and real time biorecognition of proteins in a liquid-gated configuration. 
      Specifically we have followed the biorecognition process of thrombin by its specific 
      aptamer. The aptamer modified device is sensitive enough to capture a change in the 
      electronic detection mechanism, one operating at low protein concentrations and the 
      other in a higher target concentration range. The high sensitivity of the device is 
      also sustained by the very low detection limits achieved (20 pM) and their high 
      selectivity when other target proteins are used. Moreover, the experimental results 
      have allowed us to quantify the equilibrium constant of the protein-aptamer binding 
      and confirm its high affinity by using the Langmuir equation.

TI  - Lufaxin, a novel factor Xa inhibitor from the salivary gland of the sand fly 
      Lutzomyia longipalpis blocks protease-activated receptor 2 activation and inhibits 
      inflammation and thrombosis in vivo.
PG  - 2185-98
LID - 10.1161/ATVBAHA.112.253906 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Blood-sucking arthropods' salivary glands contain a remarkable diversity 
      of antihemostatics. The aim of the present study was to identify the unique salivary 
      anticoagulant of the sand fly Lutzomyia longipalpis, which remained elusive for 
      decades. METHODS AND RESULTS: Several L. longipalpis salivary proteins were 
      expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 cells and screened for inhibition of blood 
      coagulation. A novel 32.4-kDa molecule, named Lufaxin, was identified as a slow, 
      tight, noncompetitive, and reversible inhibitor of factor Xa (FXa). Notably, 
      Lufaxin's primary sequence does not share similarity to any physiological or 
      salivary inhibitors of coagulation reported to date. Lufaxin is specific for FXa and 
      does not interact with FX, Dansyl-Glu-Gly-Arg-FXa, or 15 other enzymes. In addition, 
      Lufaxin blocks prothrombinase and increases both prothrombin time and activated 
      partial thromboplastin time. Surface plasmon resonance experiments revealed that FXa 
      binds Lufaxin with an equilibrium constant ≈3 nM, and isothermal titration 
      calorimetry determined a stoichiometry of 1:1. Lufaxin also prevents 
      protease-activated receptor 2 activation by FXa in the MDA-MB-231 cell line and 
      abrogates edema formation triggered by injection of FXa in the paw of mice. 
      Moreover, Lufaxin prevents FeCl(3)-induced carotid artery thrombus formation and 
      prolongs activated partial thromboplastin time ex vivo, implying that it works as an 
      anticoagulant in vivo. Finally, salivary gland of sand flies was found to inhibit 
      FXa and to interact with the enzyme. CONCLUSIONS: Lufaxin belongs to a novel family 
      of slow-tight FXa inhibitors, which display antithrombotic and anti-inflammatory 
      activities. It is a useful tool to understand FXa structural features and its role 
      in prohemostatic and proinflammatory events.

AB  - In this paper we describe the expression, purification, kinetics and biophysical 
      characterization of alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) from the barley plant (Hordeum 
      vulgare). This dimeric PLP-dependent enzyme is a pivotal element of several key 
      metabolic pathways from nitrogen assimilation to carbon metabolism, and its 
      introduction into transgenic plants results in increased yield. The enzyme exhibits 
      a bi-bi ping-pong reaction mechanism with a K(m) for alanine, 2-oxoglutarate, 
      glutamate and pyruvate of 3.8, 0.3, 0.8 and 0.2 mM, respectively. Barley AlaAT 
      catalyzes the forward (alanine-forming) reaction with a k(cat) of 25.6 s(-1), the 
      reverse (glutamate-forming) reaction with k(cat) of 12.1 s(-1) and an equilibrium 
      constant of ~0.5. The enzyme is also able to utilize aspartate and oxaloacetate with 
      ~10% efficiency as compared to the native substrates, which makes it much more 
      specific than related bacterial/archaeal enzymes (that also have lower K(m) values). 
      We have crystallized barley AlaAT in complex with PLP and l-cycloserine and solved 
      the structure of this complex at 2.7 Å resolution. This is the first example of a 
      plant AlaAT structure, and it reveals a canonical aminotransferase fold similar to 
      structures of the Thermotoga maritima, Pyrococcus furiosus, and human enzymes. This 
      structure bridges our structural understanding of AlaAT mechanism between three 
      kingdoms of life and allows us to shed some light on the specifics of the catalysis 
      performed by these proteins.

TI  - A review of the binding-change mechanism for proton-translocating transhydrogenase.
PG  - 1839-46
LID - 10.1016/j.bbabio.2012.04.006 [doi]
AB  - Proton-translocating transhydrogenase is found in the inner membranes of animal 
      mitochondria, and in the cytoplasmic membranes of many bacteria. It catalyses 
      hydride transfer from NADH to NADP(+) coupled to inward proton translocation. 
      Evidence is reviewed suggesting the enzyme operates by a "binding-change" mechanism. 
      Experiments with Escherichia coli transhydrogenase indicate the enzyme is driven 
      between "open" and "occluded" states by protonation and deprotonation reactions 
      associated with proton translocation. In the open states NADP(+)/NADPH can rapidly 
      associate with, or dissociate from, the enzyme, and hydride transfer is prevented. 
      In the occluded states bound NADP(+)/NADPH cannot dissociate, and hydride transfer 
      is allowed. Crystal structures of a complex of the nucleotide-binding components of 
      Rhodospirillum rubrum transhydrogenase show how hydride transfer is enabled and 
      disabled at appropriate steps in catalysis, and how release of NADP(+)/NADPH is 
      restricted in the occluded state. Thermodynamic and kinetic studies indicate that 
      the equilibrium constant for hydride transfer on the enzyme is elevated as a 
      consequence of the tight binding of NADPH relative to NADP(+). The protonation site 
      in the translocation pathway must face the outside if NADP(+) is bound, the inside 
      if NADPH is bound. Chemical shift changes detected by NMR may show where alterations 
      in protein conformation resulting from NADP(+) reduction are initiated. This article 
      is part of a Special Issue entitled: 17th European Bioenergetics Conference (EBEC 
      2012).

TI  - Kinetic mechanism of initiation by RepD as a part of asymmetric, rolling circle 
      plasmid unwinding.
PG  - 3684-93
LID - 10.1021/bi300172p [doi]
AB  - Some bacterial plasmids carry antibiotic resistance genes and replicate by an 
      asymmetric, rolling circle mechanism, in which replication of the two strands is not 
      concurrent. Initiation of this replication occurs via an initiator protein that 
      nicks one DNA strand at the double-stranded origin of replication. In this work, 
      RepD protein from the staphylococcal plasmid pC221 carries this function and allows 
      PcrA helicase to bind and begin unwinding the plasmid DNA. This work uses whole 
      plasmid constructs as well as oligonucleotide-based mimics of parts of the origin to 
      examine the initiation reaction. It investigates the phenomenon that nicking, 
      although required to open a single-stranded region at the origin and so allow PcrA 
      to bind, is not required for another function of RepD, namely to increase the 
      processivity of PcrA, allowing it to unwind plasmid lengths of DNA. A kinetic 
      mechanism of RepD initiation is presented, showing rapid binding of the origin DNA. 
      The rate of nicking varies with the structure of the DNA but can occur with a rate 
      constant of >25 s(-1) at 30 °C. The equilibrium constant of the nicking reaction, 
      which involves a transesterification to form a phosphotyrosine bond within the RepD 
      active site, is close to unity.

TI  - Molecular and catalytic properties of monoacetylphloroglucinol acetyltransferase 
      from Pseudomonas sp. YGJ3.
PG  - 559-66
AB  - Monoacetylphloroglucinol (MAPG) acetyltransferase, catalyzing the conversion of MAPG 
      to 2,4-diacetylphloroglucinol (DAPG), was purified from Pseudomonas sp. YGJ3 grown 
      without Cl(-). Cl(-) and pyoluteorin repressed expression of the enzyme. 
      SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis showed that the purified enzyme (M(r)=330 
      kDa) was composed of three subunits of 17, 38, and 43 kDa, and protein sequencing 
      identified these as PhlB, PhlA, and PhlC respectively. The enzyme catalyzed the 
      reversible disproportionation of 2 moles of MAPG to phloroglucinol (PG) and DAPG. 
      The equilibrium constant K (=[DAPG][PG]/[MAPG](2)) was estimated to be about 1.0 at 
      25 °C. A KpnI 20-kb DNA fragment was cloned from the genomic DNA of strain YGJ3, and 
      a 12,598-bp long DNA region containing the phl gene cluster phlACBDEFGHI was 
      sequenced. PCR cloning and expression of the phl genes in Escherichia coli confirmed 
      that expression of phlACB genes produced MAPG ATase.

LID - 10.1007/s00726-012-1276-0 [doi]
AB  - This study presents a design of a highly potent and competitive inhibitory peptide 
      for 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA reductase (HMGR). HMGR is the major regulatory 
      enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis and the target enzyme of many investigations 
      aimed at lowering the rate of cholesterol biosynthesis. In previous studies, the two 
      hypocholesterolemic peptides (LPYP and IAVPGEVA) were isolated and identified from 
      soy protein. Based on these peptide sequences, a number of peptides were designed 
      previously by using the correlation between the conformational flexibility and 
      bioactivity. The design method that was applied in previous studies was slightly 
      modified for the purpose of the current research and 12 new peptides were designed 
      and synthesized. Among all peptides, SFGYVAE showed the highest ability to inhibit 
      HMGR. A kinetic analysis revealed that this peptide is a competitive inhibitor of 
      HMG-CoA with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor binding (K (i)) of 12 ± 0.4 nM. 
      This is an overall 14,500-fold increase in inhibitory activity compared to the first 
      isolated LPYP peptide from soybeans. Conformational data support a conformation of 
      the designed peptides close to the bioactive conformation of the previously 
      synthesized active peptides.

TI  - Intrinsic DNA synthesis fidelity of xenotropic murine leukemia virus-related virus 
      reverse transcriptase.
PG  - 1433-44

AB  - Although recent reports have provided strong evidence to suggest that xenotropic 
      murine leukemia virus-related virus (XMRV) is unlikely to be the causative agent of 
      prostate cancer and chronic fatigue syndrome, this recombinant retrovirus can 
      nonetheless infect human cells in vitro and induce a chronic infection in macaques. 
      In the present study, we determined the accuracy of DNA synthesis of the reverse 
      transcriptases (RTs) of XMRV and Moloney murine leukemia virus (MoMLV) using a 
      combination of pre-steady-state kinetics of nucleotide incorporation and an 
      M13mp2-based forward mutation assay. The results obtained were compared with those 
      previously reported for the HIV type 1 BH10 strain (HIV-1(BH10)) RT. MoMLV and XMRV 
      RTs were 13.9 and 110 times less efficient [as determined by the catalytic rate 
      constant of the nucleotide incorporation reaction ((pol))/equilibrium constant 
      (K(d))] than the HIV-1(BH10) RT in incorporating correct nucleotides. Misinsertion 
      and mispair extension kinetic studies demonstrated that MoMLV RT was more accurate 
      than the HIV-1(BH10) RT. In comparison with the MoMLV RT, the XMRV RT showed 
      decreased mispair extension fidelity and was less faithful when misincorporating C 
      or A opposite A. However, the XMRV RT showed stronger selectivity against G in 
      misinsertion fidelity assays. Forward mutation assays revealed that XMRV and MoMLV 
      RTs had similar accuracy of DNA-dependent DNA synthesis, but were > 13 times more 
      faithful than the HIV-1(BH10) enzyme. The mutational spectra of XMRV and MoMLV RTs 
      were similar in having a relatively higher proportion of frameshifts and 
      transversions compared with the HIV-1(BH10) RT. However, the XMRV polymerase was 
      less prone to introduce large deletions and one-nucleotide insertions.

TI  - The membrane modulates internal proton transfer in cytochrome c oxidase.
PG  - 1092-100
LID - 10.1021/bi201795c [doi]
AB  - The functionality of membrane proteins is often modulated by the surrounding 
      membrane. Here, we investigated the effect of membrane reconstitution of purified 
      cytochrome c oxidase (CytcO) on the kinetics and thermodynamics of internal electron 
      and proton-transfer reactions during O(2) reduction. Reconstitution of the 
      detergent-solubilized enzyme in small unilamellar soybean phosphatidylcholine 
      vesicles resulted in a lowering of the pK(a) in the pH dependence profile of the 
      proton-uptake rate. This pK(a) change resulted in decreased proton-uptake rates in 
      the pH range of ~6.5-9.5, which is explained in terms of lowering of the pK(a) of an 
      internal proton donor within CytcO. At pH 7.5, the rate decreased to the same extent 
      when vesicles were prepared from the pure zwitterionic lipid 
      1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC) or the anionic lipid 
      1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho(1-rac-glycerol) (DOPG). In addition, a small 
      change in the internal Cu(A)-heme a electron equilibrium constant was observed. This 
      effect was lipid-dependent and explained in terms of a lower electrostatic potential 
      within the membrane-spanning part of the protein with the anionic DOPG lipids than 
      with the zwitterionic DOPC lipids. In conclusion, the data show that the membrane 
      significantly modulates internal charge-transfer reactions and thereby the function 
      of the membrane-bound enzyme.

      distributions reflecting protein dimerization.
PG  - 28-32
LID - 10.1016/j.ab.2011.12.010 [doi]
AB  - This reexamination of a high-speed sedimentation equilibrium distribution for 
      α-chymotrypsin under slightly acidic conditions (pH 4.1, I(M) 0.05) has provided 
      experimental support for the adequacy of nearest-neighbor considerations in the 
      allowance for effects of thermodynamic nonideality in the characterization of 
      protein self-association over a moderate concentration range (up to 8 mg/mL). A 
      widely held but previously untested notion about allowance for thermodynamic 
      nonideality effects is thereby verified experimentally. However, it has also been 
      shown that a greater obstacle to better characterization of protein self-association 
      is likely to be the lack of a reliable estimate of monomer net charge, a parameter 
      that has a far more profound effect on the magnitude of the measured equilibrium 
      constant than any deficiency in current procedures for incorporating the effects of 
      thermodynamic nonideality into the analysis of sedimentation equilibrium 
      distributions reflecting reversible protein self-association.

AB  - This study focuses on the humidity adsorption kinetics of an isopropanol-induced and 
      pH-triggered bovine pancreatic trypsin gel (BPTG). The BPTG was adsorbed on a gold 
      coated Quartz Crystal Microbalance (QCM) substrate with a thickness of 376 nm. The 
      morphology of the film was characterized using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM). QCM 
      was used to investigate the humidity sensing properties of the BPTG film. The 
      response of the humidity sensor was explained using the Langmuir model. The average 
      values of adsorption and desorption rates between 11% RH (relative humidity) and 97% 
      RH were calculated as 2482.5 M(-1) s(-1) and 0.02 s(-1), respectively. The 
      equilibrium constant and average Gibbs Free Energy of humidity adsorption and 
      desorption cycles were obtained as 133,000 and -11.8 kJ/mol, respectively.

PG  - 637-42
LID - 10.1007/s11095-011-0612-5 [doi]
AB  - PK/PD modeling is enhanced by improvements in the accuracy of its metrics. For PK/PD 
      modeling of drugs and biologics that interact with enzymes or receptors, the 
      equilibrium constant of the interaction can provide critical insight. Methodologies 
      such as radioliogand binding and isolated tissue preparations can provide estimates 
      of the equilibrium constants (as the dissociation constant, K value) for drugs and 
      endogenous ligands that interact with specific enzymes and receptors. However, an 
      impediment to further precision for PK/PD modeling is that it remains a problem to 
      convert the concentration of drug in bulk solution (A) into an estimate of receptor 
      occupation, since A is not necessarily the concentration (C) of drug in the biophase 
      that yields fractional binding from the law of mass action, viz., C/(C + K). In most 
      experimental studies A is much larger than K, so the use of administered instead of 
      biophase concentration gives fractional occupancies very close to unity. We here 
      provide a simple way to obtain an estimate of the factor that converts the total 
      drug concentration into the biophase concentration in isolated tissue preparation. 
      Our approach is an extension of the now classic 'null method' introduced and applied 
      by Furchgott to determination of drug-receptor dissociation constants.

      process.
PG  - 26-39
LID - 10.1016/j.cis.2011.07.003 [doi]
AB  - The confinement of chemical reactions in nano-capsules can lead to a dramatic effect 
      on the equilibrium constant of these latter. Indeed, capillary effects due to the 
      curvature and surface energy of nano-capsules can alter in a noticeable way the 
      evolution of reactions occurring within. Nano-encapsulation of bio-materials has 
      attracted lately wide interest from the scientific community because of the great 
      potential of its applications in biomedical areas and targeted therapies. The 
      present paper focuses one's attention on alterations of conformation mechanisms due 
      to extremely confining and interacting solvated dipolar macromolecules at their 
      isoelectric point. As a specific example studied here, the folding-unfolding 
      reaction of proteins (particularly RNase A and creatine kinase CK) is drastically 
      changed when encapsulated in solid inorganic hollow nano-capsules. The effects 
      demonstrated in this work can be extended to a wide variety of nano-encapsulation 
      situations. The design and sizing of nano-capsules can even make use of the effects 
      shown in the present study to achieve better and more effective encapsulation.

      amino acid amides and oligoglycines at glycine betaine (GB) concentrations ranging 
      from 0 to 4 M. We use these results to evaluate the volumetric contributions of 
      amino acid side chains and the glycyl unit (-CH(2)CONH-) as a function of GB 
      concentration. We analyze the resulting GB dependences within the framework of a 
      statistical thermodynamic model and evaluate the equilibrium constant for the 
      reaction in which a GB molecule binds each of the functionalities under study 
      replacing four water molecules. We calculate the free energy of the transfer of 
      functional groups from water to concentrated GB solutions, ΔG(tr), as the sum of a 
      change in the free energy of cavity formation, ΔΔG(C), and the differential free 
      energy of solute-solvent interactions, ΔΔG(I), in a concentrated GB solution and 
      water. Our results suggest that the transfer free energy, ΔG(tr), results from a 
      fine balance between the large ΔΔG(C) and ΔΔG(I) contributions. The range of the 
      magnitudes and the shape of the GB dependence of ΔG(tr) depend on the identity of a 
      specific solute group. The interplay between ΔΔG(C) and ΔΔG(I) results in pronounced 
      maxima in the GB dependences of ΔG(tr) for the Val, Leu, Ile, Trp, Tyr, and Gln side 
      chains as well as the glycyl unit. This observation is in qualitative agreement with 
      the experimental maxima in the T(M)-versus-GB concentration plots reported for 
      ribonuclease A and lysozyme.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop an antibody-based flow cytometric assay to detect coated 
      platelets in dogs and to characterize the interaction of recombinant human 
      coagulation factor VIIa with activated platelets from dogs with hemophilia A. 
      SAMPLE: Platelets from 4 dogs with hemophilia A, 4 dogs with hemophilia B, 4 dogs 
      with von Willebrand disease, and 6 hemostatically normal dogs. PROCEDURES: Freshly 
      isolated platelets were activated with thrombin, convulxin, or a thrombin-convulxin 
      combination. Resulting platelet phenotypes were resolved on the basis of P-selectin 
      and fibrinogen expression, and binding of recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa 
      to these distinct platelet subpopulations was measured by use of a flow cytometric 
      assay. RESULTS: Coated platelets were identified on the basis of expression of 
      α-granule fibrinogen and were generated in response to stimulation with the 
      thrombin-convulxin combination but not to stimulation with either agonist alone. 
      Approximately 70% of the platelets from dogs with hemophilia A, hemophilia B, and 
      von Willebrand disease and from the control dogs had the coated platelet phenotype. 
      Recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa bound preferentially to coated platelets 
      with a mean ± SD binding equilibrium constant of 2.6 ± 0.5μM. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Formation of coated platelets in dogs was similar to that in 
      humans. Recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa bound preferentially to coated 
      platelets from dogs. IMPACT FOR HUMAN MEDICINE: A similar mechanism of action for 
      recombinant human coagulation factor VIIa may exist in dogs and humans. The 
      potential for use of dogs in the study of bleeding disorders in humans was 
      strengthened.

AB  - One emphasis of the Gibbs Conference on Biothermodynamics is the value of 
      thermodynamic measurements for understanding behaviors of biological systems. In 
      this study, the correlation between thermodynamic measurements of in vitro DNA 
      binding affinity with in vivo transcription repression was investigated for two 
      transcription repressors. In the first system, which comprised an engineered 
      LacI/GalR homolog, mutational changes altered the equilibrium constant for binding 
      DNA. Changes correlated with altered repression, but estimates of in vivo repressor 
      concentration suggest a ≥25-fold discrepancy with in vitro conditions. In the second 
      system, changes in ligand binding to BirA altered dimerization and subsequent DNA 
      occupancy. Again, these changes correlate with altered in vivo repression, but 
      comparison with in vitro measurements reveals a ~10-fold discrepancy. Further 
      analysis of each system suggests that the observed discrepancies between in vitro 
      and in vivo results reflect the contributions of additional equilibria to the 
      transcription repression process.

PG  - 5136-45
LID - 10.1016/j.chroma.2011.05.085 [doi]
AB  - A large number of different stationary phases for ion-exchange chromatography from 
      different manufacturers are available, which vary significantly in a number of 
      chemical and physical properties. As a consequence, binding mechanisms may be 
      different as well. In the work reported here, the retention data of model proteins 
      (lysozyme, cytochrome c and two monoclonal antibodies) were determined for nine 
      commercially available cation-exchange adsorbents. The linear gradient elution model 
      in combination with a thermodynamic approach was used to analyse the characteristic 
      parameters of the protein-stationary phase-interactions. Based on the pH dependency 
      of the characteristic charge and the equilibrium constant for binding the 
      differences between the standard Gibbs energies in the adsorbed and the solute state 
      for the protein ΔG(P)° and the salt ΔG(S)° were calculated. The characteristic 
      charge B of the proteins strongly depends on the molecular mass of the protein. For 
      small proteins like lysozyme there is almost no influence of the stationary phase 
      chemistry on B, while for the Mabs the surface modification strongly influences the 
      B value. Surface extenders or tentacles usually increase the B values. The variation 
      of the characteristic charge of the MABs is more pronounced the lower the pH value 
      of the mobile phase is, i.e. the higher the negative net charge of the protein is. 
      The standard Gibbs energy changes for the proteins ΔG(P)° are higher for the Mabs 
      compared to lysozyme and more strongly depend on the stationary phase properties. 
      Surface modified resins usually show higher ΔG(P)° and higher B values. A 
      correlation between ΔG(P)° and B is not observed, indicating that non-electrostatic 
      interactions as well as entropic factors are important for ΔG(P)° while for the B 
      values the accessibility of binding sites on the protein surface is most important.

AB  - Theory is developed for the characterization of protein interactions by spectral 
      techniques, where the constraints of constant temperature and pressure demand that 
      thermodynamic activity be defined on the molal concentration scale. The customary 
      practice of defining the equilibrium constant (K) on a molar basis is accommodated 
      by developing expressions to convert those experimental values (K(molar)) to their 
      thermodynamically more rigorous counterparts (K(molal)). Such procedures are 
      illustrated by reanalysis of published results for the effects of molecular crowding 
      agents on the isomerisation of α-chymotrypsin and reversible complex formation 
      between catalase and superoxide dismutase. Although those reanalyses have led to 
      only minor refinements of the quantitative interpretation, it is clearly preferable 
      to adopt thermodynamic rigor throughout future spectral studies by employing the 
      molal concentration scale from the outset.

AB  - Chemical equations are normally written in terms of specific ionic and elemental 
      species and balance atoms of elements and electric charge. However, in a biochemical 
      context it is usually better to write them with ionic reactants expressed as totals 
      of species in equilibrium with each other. This implies that atoms of elements 
      assumed to be at fixed concentrations, such as hydrogen at a specified pH, should 
      not be balanced in a biochemical equation used for thermodynamic analysis. However, 
      both kinds of equations are needed in biochemistry. The apparent equilibrium 
      constant K' for a biochemical reaction is written in terms of such sums of species 
      and can be used to calculate standard transformed Gibbs energies of reaction 
      Δ(r)G'°. This property for a biochemical reaction can be calculated from the 
      standard transformed Gibbs energies of formation Δ(f)G(i)'° of reactants, which can 
      be calculated from the standard Gibbs energies of formation of species Δ(f)G(j)° and 
      measured apparent equilibrium constants of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Tables of 
      Δ(r)G'° of reactions and Δ(f)G(i)'° of reactants as functions of pH and temperature 
      are available on the web, as are functions for calculating these properties. 
      Biochemical thermodynamics is also important in enzyme kinetics because apparent 
      equilibrium constant K' can be calculated from experimentally determined kinetic 
      parameters when initial velocities have been determined for both forward and reverse 
      reactions. Specific recommendations are made for reporting experimental results in 
      the literature.

TI  - Zinc ion-tetraphenylporphyrin interactions in the ground and excited states.
PG  - 131-6

AB  - In the present article, tetraphenylporphyrin a new ratiometric fluorescence 
      sensitizer for zinc ion has been proposed. Electronic absorption, emission and (1)H 
      NMR spectral characteristics of meso-tetraphenylporphyrin (TPP) have been studied in 
      acetonitrile medium in the presence of zinc perchlorate. Absorption spectral studies 
      indicate the formation of a new complex between zinc ion and the porphyrin moiety in 
      the ground state as distinguished from the characteristics of metalo(zinc) porphyrin 
      compound. The energy of maximum fluorescence of porphyrin shifts towards blue with 
      the addition of Zn(ClO(4))(2). Steady state emission studies point to the existence 
      of two emitting species viz, the solvated and the complexed porphyrin in 
      equilibrium. The fluorescence emission of tetraphenylporphyrin at 651-nm bands 
      decreases while that at 605 nm increases upon zinc ion interaction in acetonitrile. 
      Thus, the TPP can behave as a ratiometric fluorescent sensor. This fluorescence 
      modulation of TPP should be applicable to dual-wavelength measurement of various 
      biomolecules or enzyme activities. (1)H NMR spectra of the porphyrin suffered a 
      radical change with the addition of zinc perchlorate which points to the formation 
      of a new porphyrin complex. This change is due to the difference in the 
      electron-donating ability of the pyrrolic nitrogens before and after complexation 
      with Zn(2+). The values of equilibrium constant for the binding process have been 
      determined in acetone and acetonitrile, in both ground and excited states.

AB  - Through virtual screening of a rationally built database consisting of 40 peptides, 
      we identified three short peptides. After testing these three synthetic peptides, we 
      found that the peptide Trp-Gly-Pro (WGP) showed comparable inhibitory ability as 
      positive control cyclosporine A (CsA) on CypA-mediated PPIase activity with IC50 
      values of 33.11 nM and 10.25 nM, respectively. The peptide WGP had same order of 
      CypA-binding affinity as CsA with dissociation equilibrium constant KD of 
      3.41×10(-6) and 6.42×10(-6) M, respectively. This peptide could also inhibit 
      HIV-1IIIB infection. This study provides a novel strategy for rational design and 
      development of peptidic drugs.

TI  - Ultrasonic analysis of kinetic mechanism of hydrolysis of cellobiose by 
      β-glucosidase.
PG  - 1-11
LID - 10.1016/j.ab.2011.03.003 [doi]
AB  - High-resolution ultrasonic spectroscopy (HR-US) was applied for real-time analysis 
      of enzymatic hydrolysis of cellobiose by a β-glucosidase from Aspergillus niger 
      (Novozyme 188) at 50°C and pH 4.9. This technique is noninvasive, it does not 
      require optical transparency and is suitable to continuously monitor the time 
      dependence of the reaction progress in a broad range of experimental conditions. The 
      time profiles of the amount of glucose released and the reaction rate were obtained 
      from the time profile of ultrasonic velocity. The results are in good agreement with 
      a discontinuous glucose assay (hexokinase method). The kinetic parameters of the 
      reaction were estimated by fitting the ultrasonic time profiles of the reaction 
      rates to several inhibition models. In addition, the equilibrium constant for the 
      reaction of hydrolysis of cellobiose and the molar Gibbs free energy of hydrolysis 
      were determined from the ultrasonic time profiles of concentration of glucose in the 
      reverse reaction (glucose condensation). The results suggest the existence of more 
      complex mechanisms regulating the activity of cellobiase than the combination of 
      simple inhibitions. An extended kinetic model based on two sites for the competitive 
      inhibitor (glucose) is proposed.

TI  - Real time detection of lysozyme by pulsed streaming potentials using polyclonal 
      antibodies immobilized on a renewable nonfouling surface inside plastic microfluidic 
      channels.
PG  - 2012-9
LID - 10.1021/ac102769j [doi]
AB  - A composite surface was prepared on cyclic olefin copolymer (COC) microchannels by 
      UV-photografting of polyethylene glycol acrylate (PEGA) and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) 
      films. A PEGA layer of globular particles with average thickness of 60 nm was formed 
      after 15 min of polymerization. Real time monitoring by pulsed streaming potentials 
      demonstrated the ability of the PEGA layer to inhibit the adhesion of five different 
      nonspecific adsorbing proteins when compared with pristine COC. Roughness determined 
      by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after PAA grafting on COC-PEGA at different UV 
      illumination times suggests that PAA formation is initiated at the free space in 
      between the PEGA particles. Carboxylic groups activated with N-hydroxysuccinimide 
      and N-ethyl-N'-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide were used to bind anti-lysozyme 
      polyclonal antibodies. The composite COC-PEGA-PAA-anti-lysozyme surface demonstrated 
      its ability to detect lysozyme with a dynamic range between 140 and 860 nM. 
      Linearity was maintained even when samples were spiked with 250 nM of cytochrome as 
      interfering species. The equilibrium constant K(eq) for the adsorption of Ly on 
      COC-PEGA-PAA-anti-Ly was estimated to be 2.7 × 10(6) M(-1), and it shows that this 
      kinetic approach of monitoring the surface charge is also useful to estimate 
      affinity interactions for proteins in label free fashion. The regeneration of the 
      surface exhibited an average percentage of recovery of ∼97% for each of six 
      adsorption-regeneration cycles. This feature enables curve calibration on a single 
      microfluidic chip because each point of the curve has a reproducible and renewable 
      surface.

PG  - 3240-5
LID - 10.1016/j.bios.2010.12.033 [doi]
AB  - Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a pivotal role in blood pressure 
      regulation, and its interaction with an ACE inhibitor (ACEI) is an important 
      research topic for treatment of hypertension. Herein, a low reagent consumption, 
      multiparameter and highly sensitive quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) at 35-MHz 
      fundamental frequency was utilized to monitor in situ the binding process of 
      solution lisinopril (LIS, a carboxylic third-generation ACEI) to ACE adsorbed at a 
      1-dodecanethiol (C12SH)-modified Au electrode. From the QCM data, the binding molar 
      ratio (r) of LIS to adsorbed ACE was estimated to be 2.3:1, and the binding and 
      dissociation rate constants (k(1) and k(-1)) and the binding equilibrium constant 
      (K(a)) were estimated to be k(1)=4.1×10(6) L mol(-1) s(-1), k(-1)=7.3×10(-3) s(-1) 
      and K(a)=5.62×10(8) L mol(-1), respectively. Comparable qualitative and quantitative 
      results were also obtained from separate experiments of cyclic voltammetry, 
      electrochemical impedance spectroscopy and surface plasmon resonance measurements.

TI  - The kinetic mechanism of mouse myosin VIIA.
PG  - 8819-28
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.163592 [doi]
AB  - Myosin VIIa is crucial in hearing and visual processes. We examined the kinetic and 
      association properties of the baculovirus expressed, truncated mouse myosin VIIa 
      construct containing the head, all 5IQ motifs and the putative coiled coil domain 
      (myosin VIIa-5IQ). The construct appears to be monomeric as determined by analytical 
      ultracentrifugation experiments, and only single headed molecules were detected by 
      negative stain electron microscopy. The relatively high basal steady-state rate of 
      0.18 s(-1) is activated by actin only by ∼3.5-fold resulting in a V(max) of 0.7 
      s(-1) and a K(ATPase) of 11.5 μM. There is no single rate-limiting step of the ATP 
      hydrolysis cycle. The ATP hydrolysis step (M·T M·D·P) is slow (12 s(-1)) and the 
      equilibrium constant (K(H)) of 1 suggests significant reversal of hydrolysis. In the 
      presence of actin ADP dissociates with a rate constant of 1.2 s(-1). Phosphate 
      dissociation is relatively fast (>12 s(-1)), but the maximal rate could not be 
      experimentally obtained at actin concentrations ≤ 50 μM because of the weak binding 
      of the myosin VIIa-ADP-P(i) complex to actin. At higher actin concentrations the 
      rate of attached hydrolysis (0.4 s(-1)) becomes significant and partially 
      rate-limiting. Our findings suggest that the myosin VIIa is a "slow", monomeric 
      molecular motor with a duty ratio of 0.6.

TI  - High-pressure EPR reveals conformational equilibria and volumetric properties of 
      spin-labeled proteins.
PG  - 1331-6
LID - 10.1073/pnas.1017877108 [doi]
AB  - Identifying equilibrium conformational exchange and characterizing conformational 
      substates is essential for elucidating mechanisms of function in proteins. 
      Site-directed spin labeling has previously been employed to detect conformational 
      changes triggered by some event, but verifying conformational exchange at 
      equilibrium is more challenging. Conformational exchange (microsecond-millisecond) 
      is slow on the EPR time scale, and this proves to be an advantage in directly 
      revealing the presence of multiple substates as distinguishable components in the 
      EPR spectrum, allowing the direct determination of equilibrium constants and free 
      energy differences. However, rotameric exchange of the spin label side chain can 
      also give rise to multiple components in the EPR spectrum. Using spin-labeled 
      mutants of T4 lysozyme, it is shown that high-pressure EPR can be used to: (i) 
      demonstrate equilibrium between spectrally resolved states, (ii) aid in 
      distinguishing conformational from rotameric exchange as the origin of the resolved 
      states, and (iii) determine the relative partial molar volume (ΔV°) and isothermal 
      compressibility (Δβ(T)) of conformational substates in two-component equilibria from 
      the pressure dependence of the equilibrium constant. These volumetric properties 
      provide insight into the structure of the substates. Finally, the pressure 
      dependence of internal side-chain motion is interpreted in terms of volume 
      fluctuations on the nanosecond time scale, the magnitude of which may reflect local 
      backbone flexibility.

TI  - Cardiolipin modulates allosterically peroxynitrite detoxification by horse heart 
      cytochrome c.
PG  - 190-4
LID - 10.1016/j.bbrc.2010.11.091 [doi]
AB  - Upon interaction with bovine heart cardiolipin (CL), horse heart cytochrome c (cytc) 
      changes its tertiary structure disrupting the heme-Fe-Met80 distal bond, reduces 
      drastically the midpoint potential out of the range required for its physiological 
      role, binds CO and NO with high affinity, and displays peroxidase activity. Here, 
      the effect of CL on peroxynitrite isomerization by ferric cytc (cytc-Fe(III)) is 
      reported. In the absence of CL, hexa-coordinated cytc does not catalyze 
      peroxynitrite isomerization. In contrast, CL facilitates cytc-Fe(III)-mediated 
      isomerization of peroxynitrite in a dose-dependent fashion inducing the 
      penta-coordination of the heme-Fe(III)-atom. The value of the second order rate 
      constant for CL-cytc-Fe(III)-mediated isomerization of peroxynitrite (k(on)) is 
      (3.2±0.4)×10(5) M(-1) s(-1). The apparent dissociation equilibrium constant for CL 
      binding to cytc-Fe(III) is (5.1±0.8)×10(-5) M. These results suggest that CL-cytc 
      could play either pro-apoptotic or anti-apoptotic effects facilitating lipid 
      peroxidation and scavenging of reactive nitrogen species, such as peroxynitrite, 
      respectively.

TI  - Conformational states of human rat sarcoma (Ras) protein complexed with its natural 
      ligand GTP and their role for effector interaction and GTP hydrolysis.
PG  - 39768-78
LID - 10.1074/jbc.M110.145235 [doi]
AB  - The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras exists in solution in two different 
      conformational states when complexed with different GTP analogs such as GppNHp or 
      GppCH(2)p. State 1 has only a very low affinity to effectors and seems to be 
      recognized by guanine nucleotide exchange factors, whereas state 2 represents the 
      high affinity effector binding state. In this work we investigate Ras in complex 
      with the physiological nucleoside triphosphate GTP. By polarization transfer (31)P 
      NMR experiments and effector binding studies we show that Ras(wt)·Mg(2+)·GTP also 
      exists in a dynamical equilibrium between the weakly populated conformational state 
      1 and the dominant state 2. At 278 K the equilibrium constant between state 1 and 
      state 2 of C-terminal truncated wild-type Ras(1-166) K(12) is 11.3. K(12) of 
      full-length Ras is >20, suggesting that the C terminus may also have a regulatory 
      effect on the conformational equilibrium. The exchange rate (k(ex)) for 
      Ras(wt)·Mg(2+)·GTP is 7 s(-1) and thus 18-fold lower compared with that found for 
      the Ras·GppNHp complex. The intrinsic GTPase activity substantially increases after 
      effector binding for the switch I mutants Ras(Y32F), (Y32R), (Y32W), (Y32C/C118S), 
      (T35S), and the switch II mutant Ras(G60A) by stabilizing state 2, with the largest 
      effect on Ras(Y32R) with a 13-fold increase compared with wild-type. In contrast, no 
      acceleration was observed in Ras(T35A). Thus Ras in conformational state 2 has a 
      higher affinity to effectors as well as a higher GTPase activity. These observations 
      can be used to explain why many mutants have a low GTPase activity but are not 
      oncogenic.

TI  - Mechanisms involved in the selection of HIV-1 reverse transcriptase thumb subdomain 
      polymorphisms associated with nucleoside analogue therapy failure.
PG  - 4799-811
LID - 10.1128/AAC.00716-10 [doi]
AB  - Previous studies showed an increased prevalence of human immunodeficiency virus type 
      1 (HIV-1) reverse transcriptase (RT) thumb subdomain polymorphisms Pro272, Arg277, 
      and Thr286 in patients failing therapy with nucleoside analogue combinations. 
      Interestingly, wild-type HIV-1(BH10) RT contains Pro272, Arg277, and Thr286. Here, 
      we demonstrate that in the presence of zidovudine, HIV-1(BH10) RT mutations 
      P272A/R277K/T286A produce a significant reduction of the viral replication capacity 
      in peripheral blood mononuclear cells in both the absence and presence of 
      M41L/T215Y. In studies carried out with recombinant enzymes, we show that RT thumb 
      subdomain mutations decrease primer-unblocking activity on RNA/DNA complexes, but 
      not on DNA/DNA template-primers. These effects were observed with primers terminated 
      with thymidine analogues (i.e., zidovudine and stavudine) and carbovir (the relevant 
      derivative of abacavir) and were more pronounced when mutations were introduced in 
      the wild-type HIV-1(BH10) RT sequence context. RT thumb subdomain mutations 
      increased by 2-fold the apparent dissociation equilibrium constant (K(d)) for 
      RNA/DNA without affecting the K(d) for DNA/DNA substrates. RNase H assays carried 
      out with RNA/DNA complexes did not reveal an increase in the reaction rate or in 
      secondary cleavage events that could account for the decreased excision activity. 
      The interaction of Arg277 with the phosphate backbone of the RNA template in HIV-1 
      RT bound to RNA/DNA and the location of Thr286 close to the RNA strand are 
      consistent with thumb polymorphisms playing a role in decreasing nucleoside RT 
      inhibitor excision activity on RNA/DNA template-primers by affecting interactions 
      with the template-primer duplex without involvement of the RNase H activity of the 
      enzyme.

AB  - Papain having the characteristics of metal binding ability is immobilized on 
      alginate bead. Design Expert Software (Version 7.1.6) uses Response Surface 
      Methodology (RSM) for statistical designing of operating condition for 
      immobilization of papain on alginate bead considering concentration of papain, 
      concentration of sodium alginate, concentration of calcium chloride and pH as 
      numeric factors and Specific Enzymatic Activity (SEA) of immobilized papain sample 
      as response. Immobilization using 25.96 g/L papain, 20 g/L sodium alginate and 20 
      g/L calcium chloride at pH 7 gives the desired product as indicated by ANOVA 
      (Analysis of Variance). Three parameters viz., initial concentration of mercury 
      (II), amount of AIP and pH are varied in a systematic manner. Maximum 98.88% removal 
      of mercury (II) has been achieved within 8 min when simulated aqueous solution of 
      mercury (II) with initial concentration of 10mg/L has been contacted with 5 g of AIP 
      at pH 9 and at 35 degrees C in a batch contactor. A mathematical model has been 
      developed and the value of equilibrium constant for binding of mercury (II) with AIP 
      has been found to be 126797.3.

AB  - Oxidation of the heme-thiolate enzyme chloroperoxidase (CPO) from Caldariomyces 
      fumago with peroxynitrite (PN) gave the Compound II intermediate, which was 
      photo-oxidized with 365 nm light to give a reactive oxidizing species. Cryo-solvents 
      at pH ≈ 6 were employed, and reactions were conducted at temperatures as low as -50° 
      C. The activity of CPO as evaluated by the chlorodimedone assay was unaltered by 
      treatment with PN or by production of the oxidizing transient and subsequent 
      reaction with styrene. EPR spectra at 77K gave the amount of ferric protein at each 
      stage in the reaction sequence. The PN oxidation step gave a 6:1 mixture of Compound 
      II and ferric CPO, the photolysis step gave an approximate 1:1 mixture of active 
      oxidant and ferric CPO, and the final mixture after reaction with excess styrene 
      contained ferric CPO in 80% yield. In single turnover reactions at -50°C, styrene 
      was oxidized to styrene oxide in high yield. Kinetic studies of styrene oxidation at 
      -50°C displayed saturation kinetics with an equilibrium constant for formation of 
      the complex of K(bind)=3.8 x 10(4)M(-1) and an oxidation rate constant of 
      k(ox)=0.30s(-1). UV-Visible spectra of mixtures formed in the photo-oxidation 
      sequence at ca. -50° C did not contain the signature Q-band absorbance at 690 nm 
      ascribed to CPO Compound I prepared by chemical oxidation of the enzyme, indicating 
      that different species were formed in the chemical oxidation and the photo-oxidation 
      sequence.

TI  - Real-time monitoring and kinetic parameter estimation of the affinity interaction of 
      jArtinM and rArtinM with peroxidase glycoprotein by the electrogravimetric 
      technique.
PG  - 36-42
LID - 10.1016/j.bios.2010.04.047 [doi]
AB  - ArtinM is a D-mannose binding lectin that has been arousing increasing interest 
      because of its biomedical properties, especially those involving the stimulation of 
      Th1 immune response, which confers protection against intracellular pathogens. The 
      potential pharmaceutical applications of ArtinM have motivated the production of its 
      recombinant form (rArtinM) so that it is important to compare the sugar-binding 
      properties of jArtinM and rArtinM in order to take better advantage of the potential 
      applications of the recombinant lectin. In this work, a biosensor framework based on 
      a Quartz Crystal Microbalance was established with the purpose of making a 
      comparative study of the activity of native and recombinant ArtinM protein. The QCM 
      transducer was strategically functionalized to use a simple model of protein binding 
      kinetics. This approach allowed for the determination of the binding/dissociation 
      kinetics rate and affinity equilibrium constant of both forms of ArtinM with 
      horseradish peroxidase glycoprotein (HRP), a N-glycosylated protein that contains 
      the trimannoside Manα1-3[Manα1-6]Man, which is a known ligand for jArtinM 
      (Jeyaprakash et al., 2004). Monitoring of the real-time binding of rArtinM shows 
      that it was able to bind HRP, leading to an analytical curve similar to that of 
      jArtinM, with statistically equivalent kinetic rates and affinity equilibrium 
      constants for both forms of ArtinM. The lower reactivity of rArtinM with HRP than 
      jArtinM was considered to be due to a difference in the number of Carbohydrate 
      Recognition Domains (CRDs) per molecule of each lectin form rather than to a 
      difference in the energy of binding per CRD of each lectin form.

AB  - Applying mass action law and quasi-steady-state theory, two cellulase kinetic models 
      namely Eqs. (5) and (8) were developed on the basis of the first and second order 
      reactions of enzyme deactivation, respectively. The two models are compared 
      according to analysis of experimental data from enzymatic hydrolysis steam-exploded 
      wheat straw. Both simulation and prediction results show Eq. (8) has much higher 
      accuracy than Eq. (5). Analysis of initial hydrolysis rate is also in accordance 
      with Eq. (8) and against Eq. (5). Fitted values of k(2) (the rate constant of 
      product formation), k(de2) (the rate constant of enzyme deactivation) and K(e) (the 
      equilibrium constant) determined from Eq. (8) are 0.4732 h(-1), 0.4011 L/(hg), and 
      16.8597 g/L, respectively. The higher the enzyme concentration is, the larger the 
      deactivation rate.

TI  - One-dimensional Brownian motion of charged nanoparticles along microtubules: a model 
      system for weak binding interactions.
PG  - 1589-97
LID - 10.1016/j.bpj.2009.12.4323 [doi]
AB  - Various proteins are known to exhibit one-dimensional Brownian motion along charged 
      rodlike polymers, such as microtubules (MTs), actin, and DNA. The electrostatic 
      interaction between the proteins and the rodlike polymers appears to be crucial for 
      one-dimensional Brownian motion, although the underlying mechanism has not been 
      fully clarified. We examined the interactions of positively-charged nanoparticles 
      composed of polyacrylamide gels with MTs. These hydrophilic nanoparticles bound to 
      MTs and displayed one-dimensional Brownian motion in a charge-dependent manner, 
      which indicates that nonspecific electrostatic interaction is sufficient for 
      one-dimensional Brownian motion. The diffusion coefficient decreased exponentially 
      with an increasing particle charge (with the exponent being 0.10 kBT per charge), 
      whereas the duration of the interaction increased exponentially (exponent of 0.22 
      kBT per charge). These results can be explained semiquantitatively if one assumes 
      that a particle repeats a cycle of binding to and movement along an MT until it 
      finally dissociates from the MT. During the movement, a particle is still 
      electrostatically constrained in the potential valley surrounding the MT. This 
      entire process can be described by a three-state model analogous to the 
      Michaelis-Menten scheme, in which the two parameters of the equilibrium constant 
      between binding and movement, and the rate of dissociation from the MT, are derived 
      as a function of the particle charge density. This study highlights the possibility 
      that the weak binding interactions between proteins and rodlike polymers, e.g., MTs, 
      are mediated by a similar, nonspecific charge-dependent mechanism.

TI  - Thermodynamic analysis of protein kinase A Ialpha activation.
PG  - 233-41
AB  - Thermodynamic analysis of protein kinase A (PKA) Ialpha activation was performed 
      using Quantum 3.3.0 docking software and a Gaussian 03W quantum mechanical 
      computational package. Expected stacking interactions between adenine of 3':5'-AMP 
      and aromatic moieties of amino acids were taken into account by means of 
      MP2/6-31G(d) IPCM (isodensity polarizable continuum model) computations (epsilon = 
      4.0). It is demonstrated that thermodynamically favorable agonist-induced PKA Ialpha 
      activation is mediated by two processes. First, 3':5'-AMP binding is accompanied by 
      structural changes leading to a thermodynamically favorable regulatory subunit 
      conformation, which is hardly realized in the absence of the ligand (DeltaG degrees 
      (R) = -23.9 +/- 8.2 kJ/mol). Second, 3':5'-AMP affinity to the regulatory subunit 
      conformation observed after agonist-induced PKA Ialpha activation is higher than 
      that to inactive holoenzyme complex (DeltaG degrees (3':5'-AMP) = -28.1 +/- 9.7 
      kJ/mol). ATP is capable of docking into the 3':5'-AMP-binding site B of the 
      regulatory subunit complexed with the catalytic one, resulting in inhibition of 
      kinase activation. True constants of 3':5'-AMP binding to PKA Ialpha holoenzyme were 
      found to be 60 and 57 microM for the regulatory subunit domains A and B, 
      respectively. These constants, unlike the binding equilibrium constant determined 
      using established experimental techniques and ranging from 15 nM to 2.9 microM, are 
      proved to be direct measures of 3':5'-AMP-PKA Ialpha binding affinity. Their values 
      are in a reasonable agreement with the changes in 3':5'-AMP concentration in the 
      cell (2-55 microM) and account for PKA Ialpha activation in response to adequate 
      stimuli.

TI  - Probing DNA binding, DNA opening, and assembly of a downstream clamp/jaw in 
      Escherichia coli RNA polymerase-lambdaP(R) promoter complexes using salt and the 
      physiological anion glutamate.
PG  - 4361-73
LID - 10.1021/bi100092a [doi]
AB  - Transcription by all RNA polymerases (RNAPs) requires a series of large-scale 
      conformational changes to form the transcriptionally competent open complex RP(o). 
      At the lambdaP(R) promoter, Escherichia coli sigma(70) RNAP first forms a wrapped, 
      closed 100 bp complex I(1). The subsequent step opens the entire DNA bubble, 
      creating the relatively unstable (open) complex I(2). Additional conformational 
      changes convert I(2) to the stable RP(o). Here we probe these events by dissecting 
      the effects of Na(+) salts of Glu(-), F(-), and Cl(-) on each step in this critical 
      process. Rapid mixing and nitrocellulose filter binding reveal that the binding 
      constant for I(1) at 25 degrees C is approximately 30-fold larger in Glu(-) than in 
      Cl(-) at the same Na(+) concentration, with the same log-log salt concentration 
      dependence for both anions. In contrast, both the rate constant and equilibrium 
      constant for DNA opening (I(1) to I(2)) are only weakly dependent on salt 
      concentration, and the opening rate constant is insensitive to replacement of Cl(-) 
      with Glu(-). These very small effects of salt concentration on a process (DNA 
      opening) that is strongly dependent on salt concentration in solution may indicate 
      that the backbones of both DNA strands interact with polymerase throughout the 
      process and/or that compensation is present between ion uptake and release. 
      Replacement of Cl(-) with Glu(-) or F(-) at 25 degrees C greatly increases the 
      lifetime of RP(o) and greatly reduces its salt concentration dependence. By analogy 
      to Hofmeister salt effects on protein folding, we propose that the excluded anions 
      Glu(-) and F(-) drive the folding and assembly of the RNAP clamp/jaw domains in the 
      conversion of I(2) to RP(o), while Cl(-) does not. Because the Hofmeister effect of 
      Glu(-) or F(-) largely compensates for the destabilizing Coulombic effect of any 
      salt on the binding of this assembly to downstream promoter DNA, RP(o) remains 
      long-lived even at 0.5 M Na(+) in Glu(-) or F(-) salts. The observation that 
      Esigma(70) RP(o) complexes are exceedingly long-lived at moderate to high Glu(-) 
      concentrations argues that Esigma(70) RNAP does not dissociate from strong promoters 
      in vivo when the cytoplasmic glutamate concentration increases during osmotic 
      stress.

TI  - Mechanism and specificity of DNA strand exchange catalyzed by vaccinia DNA 
      topoisomerase type I.
PG  - 2786-95
LID - 10.1021/bi902204v [doi]
AB  - The type I DNA topoisomerase from vaccinia virus (vTopo) forms a reversible covalent 
      3'-phosphotyrosyl linkage with a single strand of duplex DNA at the preferred 
      sequence 5'-(C/T)CCTTp downward arrowN(-1)N(-2)N(-3)-3'. The enzyme-DNA covalent 
      adduct is recombinogenic in cells, because the nicked strand downstream of the 
      cleavage site can dissociate and be replaced by another DNA strand, potentially 
      resulting in genome rearrangements if the enzyme executes strand ligation. Topo I 
      could play an active role in strand exchange, either by altering the kinetics or 
      thermodynamics of DNA strand binding or by serving as a proofreading gate to prevent 
      ligation of incoming DNA strands containing mismatches. To address these questions, 
      we have measured the kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for strand annealing to a 
      purified vaccinia Topo I-DNA (vTopo-DNA) covalent complex containing a single-strand 
      overhang and then compared them with the same overhang duplex in the absence of 
      vTopo. We found that vTopo accelerates the strand association rate by 2-fold but has 
      no effect on the rate of strand dissociation. vTopo has a similar small effect on 
      the annealing parameters of a series of DNA strands containing single mismatches. In 
      contrast, single base mismatches at the -1, -2, or -3 positions decreased the 
      forward rate and equilibrium constant for reversible strand ligation by 10-fold. 
      These data establish that while vTopo is a bystander during the annealing step of 
      strand exchange, the enzyme strongly discriminates against mismatches close to the 
      cleavage site during the subsequent events leading to strand ligation. A mechanism 
      emerges where vTopo oscillates between an open state where the downstream DNA 
      segment does not interact with the enzyme and a closed state where catalytically 
      important contacts are formed with this region. This oscillation between an open and 
      closed state of the covalently bound enzyme is likely important for regulating the 
      number of DNA superhelical turns that are removed during the lifetime of the 
      covalent complex with supercoiled substrates.

AB  - Oxidation of photosystem I (PSI) donors under far-red light (FRL), slow re-reduction 
      by stromal reductants and fast re-reduction in the dark subsequent to illumination 
      by white light (WL) were recorded in leaves of several C(3) plants at 810 and 950 
      nm. During the re-reduction from stromal reductants the mutual interdependence of 
      the two signals followed the theoretical relationship calculated assuming redox 
      equilibrium between plastocyanin (PC) and P700, with the equilibrium constant of 40 
      +/- 10 (Delta E (m) = 86-99 mV) in most of the measured 24 leaves of nine plant 
      species. The presence of non-oxidizable PC of up to 13% of the whole pool, 
      indicating partial control of electron transport by PC diffusion, was transiently 
      detected during a saturation pulse of white light superimposed on FRL or on low WL. 
      Nevertheless, non-oxidizable PC was absent in the steady state during fast 
      light-saturated photosynthesis. It is concluded that in leaves during steady state 
      photosynthesis the electron transport rate is not critically limited by PC 
      diffusion, but the high-potential electron carriers PC and P700 remain close to the 
      redox equilibrium.

TI  - Evaluation of mixed-salt effects on thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of RNA 
      polymerase-promoter DNA complexes in terms of equivalent salt concentrations. 
      General applicability to DNA complexes.
PG  - 695-702
AB  - Facile evaluation of mixed-salt effect on the strongly salt-dependent thermodynamic 
      and kinetic parameters of protein-DNA complexes is of importance for relevant 
      biochemical and biophysical studies. In pursuit of this aim, binding isotherms for 
      open transcription complex (RPo) of Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (R) at 
      lambdaP(R) promoter DNA (P) were determined as a function of salt concentration in 
      pure NaCl and Tris/HCl solutions, and as a function of [NaCl] in the presence of 
      fixed concentrations of MgCl(2) and Tris/HCl. A concept of equivalent salt 
      concentrations, i.e. concentrations at which the binding equilibrium constant is the 
      same, was introduced and applied for prediction of binding isotherms in mixed salt 
      solutions. Full coincidence between the experimental and predicted isotherms 
      indicated that individual contributions of salts to the global salt-effect are 
      additive in a broad range of salt concentrations. A generalized formula for 
      calculation of salt equivalents characteristic for any of the thermodynamic or 
      kinetic parameters of a complex (e.g., free energy, binding equilibrium and 
      association/dissociation kinetic rate constants) is presented and its applicability 
      to a number of protein-DNA complexes and dsDNA melting demonstrated using authors' 
      own and literature data.

TI  - A kinetic model that explains the effect of inorganic phosphate on the mechanics and

PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1098/rspb.2009.1498 [doi]
AB  - A conventional five-step chemo-mechanical cycle of the myosin-actin ATPase reaction, 
      which implies myosin detachment from actin upon release of hydrolysis products (ADP 
      and phosphate, Pi) and binding of a new ATP molecule, is able to fit the [Pi] 
      dependence of the force and number of myosin motors during isometric contraction of 
      skeletal muscle. However, this scheme is not able to explain why the isometric 
      ATPase rate of fast skeletal muscle is decreased by an increase in [Pi] much less 
      than the number of motors. The question can be solved assuming the presence of a 
      branch in the cycle: in isometric contraction, when the force generation process by 
      the myosin motor is biased at the start of the working stroke, the motor can detach 
      at an early stage of the ATPase cycle, with Pi still bound to its catalytic site, 
      and then rapidly release the hydrolysis products and bind another ATP. In this way, 
      the model predicts that in fast skeletal muscle the energetic cost of isometric 
      contraction increases with [Pi]. The large dissociation constant of the product 
      release in the branched pathway allows the isometric myosin-actin reaction to fit 
      the equilibrium constant of the ATPase.

      method.
PG  - 10620-36
LID - 10.1021/bi900940q [doi]
AB  - The dynamics of the nucleotide binding to a single, noninteracting 
      nucleotide-binding site of the hexameric helicase RepA protein of plasmid RSF1010 
      has been examined, using the fluorescence stopped-flow method. The experiments have 
      been performed with fluorescent analogues of ATP and ADP, TNP-ATP and TNP-ADP, 
      respectively. In the presence of Mg(2+), the association of the cofactors proceeds 
      as a sequential three-step process [Formula: see text] The sequential nature of the 
      mechanism indicates the lack of significant conformational equilibria of the 
      helicase prior to nucleotide binding. The major conformational change of the RepA 
      helicase-nucleotide complex occurs in the formation of (H-N)(2), which is 
      characterized by a very high value of the partial equilibrium constant and large 
      positive changes in the apparent enthalpy and entropy. Strong stabilizing 
      interactions between subunits of the RepA hexamer contribute to the observed 
      dynamics and energetics of the internal transitions of the formed complexes. 
      Magnesium cations mediate the efficient and fast conformational transitions of the 
      protein, in a manner independent of the structure of the cofactor phosphate group. 
      The ssDNA bound to the enzyme preferentially selects a single intermediate of the 
      RepA-ATP analogue complex, (H-N)(2), while the DNA has no effect on the 
      intermediates of the RepA-ADP complex. Allosteric interactions between the 
      nucleotide- and DNA-binding site are established in the initial stages of formation 
      of the complex. Moreover, in the presence of the single-stranded DNA, all the 
      transitions in the nucleotide binding to the helicase become sensitive to the 
      structure of the phosphate group of the cofactor.

TI  - An extended AE-rich N-terminal trunk in secreted pineapple cystatin enhances 
      inhibition of fruit bromelain and is posttranslationally removed during ripening.
PG  - 515-27

AB  - Phytocystatins are potent inhibitors of cysteine proteases and have been shown to 
      participate in senescence, seed and organ biogenesis, and plant defense. However, 
      phytocystatins are generally poor inhibitors of the cysteine protease, bromelain, of 
      pineapple (Ananas comosus). Here, we demonstrated that pineapple cystatin, AcCYS1, 
      inhibited (>95%) stem and fruit bromelain. AcCYS1 is a unique cystatin in that it 
      contains an extended N-terminal trunk (NTT) of 63 residues rich in alanine and 
      glutamate. A signal peptide preceding the NTT is processed in vitro by microsomal 
      membranes giving rise to a 27-kD species. AcCYS1 mRNA was present in roots and 
      leaves but was most abundant in fruit. Using immunofluorescence and immunoelectron 
      microscopy with an AcCYS1-specific antiserum, AcCYS1 was found in the apoplasm. 
      Immunoblot analysis identified a 27-kD protein in fruit, roots, and leaves and a 
      15-kD species in mature ripe fruit. Ripe fruit extracts proteolytically removed the 
      NTT of 27-kD AcCYS1 in vitro to produce the 15-kD species. Mass spectrometry 
      analysis was used to map the primary cleavage site immediately after a conserved 
      critical glycine-94. The AE-rich NTT was required to inhibit fruit and stem 
      bromelain (>95%), whereas its removal decreased inhibition to 20% (fruit) and 80% 
      (stem) and increased the dissociation equilibrium constant by 1.8-fold as determined 
      by surface plasmon resonance assays. We propose that proteolytic removal of the NTT 
      results in the decrease of the inhibitory potency of AcCYS1 against fruit bromelain 
      during fruit ripening to increase tissue proteolysis, softening, and degradation.

AB  - This article deals with the rapid-equilibrium kinetics of the forward and reverse 
      reactions together for the ordered and random enzyme-catalyzed A+B=P+Q and 
      emphasizes the importance of reporting the values of the full set of equilibrium 
      constants. Equilibrium constants that are not in the rate equation can be calculated 
      for random mechanisms using thermodynamic cycles. This treatment is based on the use 
      of a computer to derive rate equations for three mechanisms and to estimate the 
      kinetic parameters with the minimum number of velocity measurements. The most 
      general of these three programs is the one to use first when the mechanism for 
      A+B=P+Q is studied for the first time. This article shows the effects of 
      experimental errors in velocity measurements on the values of the kinetic parameters 
      and on the apparent equilibrium constant calculated using the Haldane relation.

TI  - Molecular determinants of a native-state prolyl isomerization.
PG  - 1017-31
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2009.02.021 [doi]
AB  - Prolyl cis/trans isomerizations determine the rates of many protein-folding 
      reactions, and they can serve as molecular switches and timers. The energy required 
      to shift the prolyl cis/trans equilibrium during these processes originates from 
      conformational reactions that are linked structurally and energetically with prolyl 
      isomerization. We used the N2 domain of the gene-3-protein of phage fd to elucidate 
      how such an energetic linkage develops in the course of folding. The Asp160-Pro161 
      bond at the tip of a beta hairpin of N2 is cis in the crystal structure, but in 
      fact, it exists as a mixture of conformers in folded N2. During refolding, about 10 
      kJ mol(-1) of conformational energy becomes available for a 75-fold shift of the 
      cis/trans equilibrium constant at Pro161, from 7/93 in the unfolded to 90/10 in the 
      folded form. We combined single- and double-mixing kinetic experiments with a 
      mutational analysis to identify the structural origin of this proline shift energy 
      and to elucidate the molecular path for the transfer of this energy to Pro161. It 
      originates largely, if not entirely, from the two-stranded beta sheet at the base of 
      the Pro161 hairpin. The two strands improve their stabilizing interactions when 
      Pro161 is cis, and this stabilization is propagated to Pro161, because the connector 
      peptides between the beta strands and Pro161 are native-like folded when Pro161 is 
      cis. In the presence of a trans-Pro161, the connector peptides are locally unfolded, 
      and thus, Pro161 is structurally and energetically uncoupled from the beta sheet. 
      Such interrelations between local folding and prolyl isomerization and the potential 
      modulation by prolyl isomerases might also be used to break and reestablish slow 
      communication pathways in proteins.

TI  - Loop-tryptophan human purine nucleoside phosphorylase reveals submillisecond protein 
      dynamics.
PG  - 3658-68
LID - 10.1021/bi802339c [doi]
AB  - Human PNP is a homotrimer containing three tryptophan residues at positions 16, 94, 
      and 178, all remote from the catalytic site. The catalytic sites of PNP are located 
      near the subunit-subunit interfaces where F159 is a catalytic site residue donated 
      from an adjacent subunit. F159 covers the top (beta) surface of the ribosyl group at 
      the catalytic site. QM/MM calculations of human PNP have shown that F159 is the 
      center of the most mobile region of the protein providing access to the substrate in 
      the active site. F159 is also the key residue in a cluster of hydrophobic residues 
      that shield catalytic site ligands from bulk solvent. Trp-free human PNP (Leuko-PNP) 
      was previously engineered by replacing the three Trp residues of native PNP with 
      Tyr. From this active construct, a single Trp residue was placed in the catalytic 
      site loop (F159W-Leuko-PNP) as a reporter group for the ribosyl region of the 
      catalytic site. The F159W-Leuko-PNP fluorescence is red shifted compared to native 
      PNP, suggesting a solvent-exposed Trp residue. Upon ligand binding (hypoxanthine), 
      the 3-fold fluorescence quench confirms conformational packing of the catalytic site 
      pocket hydrophobic cluster. F159W-Leuko-PNP has an on-enzyme thermodynamic 
      equilibrium constant (Keq) near unity in the temperature range between 20 and 30 
      degrees C and nonzero enthalpic components, making it suitable for laser-induced 
      T-jump analyses. T-jump relaxation kinetics of F159W-Leuko-PNP in equilibrium with 
      substrates and/or products indicate the conformational equilibria of at least two 
      ternary complex intermediates in the nano- to millisecond time scale (1000-10000 
      s-1) that equilibrate prior to the slower chemical step (approximately 200 s-1). 
      F159W-Leuko-PNP provides a novel protein platform to investigate the protein 
      conformational dynamics occurring prior to transition state formation.

TI  - Enthalpy-driven RNA folding: single-molecule thermodynamics of tetraloop-receptor 
      tertiary interaction.
PG  - 2550-8
LID - 10.1021/bi8019788 [doi]
AB  - RNA folding thermodynamics are crucial for structure prediction, which requires 
      characterization of both enthalpic and entropic contributions of tertiary motifs to 
      conformational stability. We explore the temperature dependence of RNA folding due 
      to the ubiquitous GAAA tetraloop-receptor docking interaction, exploiting 
      immobilized and freely diffusing single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy 
      transfer (smFRET) methods. The equilibrium constant for intramolecular docking is 
      obtained as a function of temperature (T = 21-47 degrees C), from which a van't Hoff 
      analysis yields the enthalpy (DeltaH degrees) and entropy (DeltaS degrees) of 
      docking. Tetraloop-receptor docking is significantly exothermic and entropically 
      unfavorable in 1 mM MgCl(2) and 100 mM NaCl, with excellent agreement between 
      immobilized (DeltaH degrees = -17.4 +/- 1.6 kcal/mol, and DeltaS degrees = -56.2 +/- 
      5.4 cal mol(-1) K(-1)) and freely diffusing (DeltaH degrees = -17.2 +/- 1.6 
      kcal/mol, and DeltaS degrees = -55.9 +/- 5.2 cal mol(-1) K(-1)) species. Kinetic 
      heterogeneity in the tetraloop-receptor construct is unaffected over the temperature 
      range investigated, indicating a large energy barrier for interconversion between 
      the actively docking and nondocking subpopulations. Formation of the 
      tetraloop-receptor interaction can account for approximately 60% of the DeltaH 
      degrees and DeltaS degrees of P4-P6 domain folding in the Tetrahymena ribozyme, 
      suggesting that it may act as a thermodynamic clamp for the domain. Comparison of 
      the isolated tetraloop-receptor and other tertiary folding thermodynamics supports a 
      theme that enthalpy- versus entropy-driven folding is determined by the number of 
      hydrogen bonding and base stacking interactions.

TI  - Investigating protein unfolding kinetics by pulse proteolysis.
PG  - 268-76
LID - 10.1002/pro.29 [doi]
AB  - Investigation of protein unfolding kinetics of proteins in crude samples may provide 
      many exciting opportunities to study protein energetics under unconventional 
      conditions. As an effort to develop a method with this capability, we employed 
      "pulse proteolysis" to investigate protein unfolding kinetics. Pulse proteolysis has 
      been shown to be an effective and facile method to determine global stability of 
      proteins by exploiting the difference in proteolytic susceptibilities between folded 
      and unfolded proteins. Electrophoretic separation after proteolysis allows 
      monitoring protein unfolding without protein purification. We employed pulse 
      proteolysis to determine unfolding kinetics of E. coli maltose binding protein (MBP) 
      and E. coli ribonuclease H (RNase H). The unfolding kinetic constants determined by 
      pulse proteolysis are in good agreement with those determined by circular dichroism. 
      We then determined an unfolding kinetic constant of overexpressed MBP in a cell 
      lysate. An accurate unfolding kinetic constant was successfully determined with the 
      unpurified MBP. Also, we investigated the effect of ligand binding on unfolding 
      kinetics of MBP using pulse proteolysis. On the basis of a kinetic model for 
      unfolding of MBP*maltose complex, we have determined the dissociation equilibrium

AB  - Alpha-Methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) is an important enzyme for the metabolism of 
      branched-chain lipids and drugs. The enzyme is over-expressed in prostate and other 
      cancers. AMACR 1A, the major splice variant, was purified from recombinant E. coli 
      cells as a His-tag protein. Purified enzyme catalysed chiral inversion of both S- 
      and R-2-methyldecanoyl-CoA, with an equilibrium constant of 1.09 +/- 0.14 (2S/2R). 
      Reactions with (2)H-labelled substrate showed that loss of the alpha-proton was a 
      prerequisite for chiral inversion. Reactions conducted in (2)H(2)O indicated that 
      reprotonation was not stereospecific. These results are the first mechanistic study 
      on any recombinant mammalian alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase.

TI  - Optimization of hydrophobic interaction chromatography using a mathematical model of 
      elution curves of a protein mixture.
PG  - 110-20
LID - 10.1002/jmr.927 [doi]
AB  - This paper describes a methodology for optimizing performance of hydrophobic 
      interaction chromatography (HIC) for protein mixtures in which Rate Model 
      simulations and evaluation of cost function are used. The system under study was HIC 
      of a two-protein mixture (alpha-chymotrypsin and alpha-amylase), carried out with 
      different conditions (gradient steepness, salt, concentration, volume of sample, pH, 
      type of matrix, and flow rates). Parameters in the rate model were obtained from 
      different sources. Mass transfer parameters (Reynolds, Peclet, and Biot numbers) 
      were calculated using empirical correlations. Under the experimental conditions Re 
      number was small (0.23) and axial dispersion negligible (PeL>300). Mass transfer was 
      controlled by intraparticle diffusion (Bi>50). The model assumes that equilibrium 
      constant (b) in the Langmuir isotherm was salt concentration (I) dependent [b(I)]. 
      Parameters in the relationship for b(I) were estimated from experimental single 
      protein elution curves and used to simulate protein mixtures. Rate model simulations 
      showed that if protein sample load to the column was below 1 mg, displacement 
      effects were negligible; in other cases protein interactions would limit the 
      proposed mathematical description of HIC. The calibrated Rate Model successfully 
      predicted elution curves of the protein mixture with deviations lower than 6x10(-4) 
      absorbance units. The model was also able to predict that the Butyl Sepharose--NaCl 
      4 M system allowed to obtain the highest resolution (>1) for the two-protein mixture 
      evaluated. The cost function built for optimizing the performance of HIC considers 
      yield, purity, concentration, and the time needed to accomplish the separation. This 
      function contains two types of parameters that have to be determined. The ones 
      dependent on the HIC system and process conditions were obtained from simulations of 
      elution curves of the two-protein mixture, by the calibrated Rate Model. The other 
      parameters are dependent on characteristic and quality of the protein product; these 
      were assumed for illustration purpose. Minimization of the cost function allows 
      determination of flow rate, gradient steepness, and the fraction of eluted peak that 
      has to be collected. Novelty of the present work is in showing how parameters in the 
      fundamentally based Rate Model for HIC can be calibrated and how simulations can be 
      used for the optimization of process conditions for the separation of a protein 
      mixture.

TI  - Changes in quaternary structure in the signaling mechanisms of PAS domains.
PG  - 12078-86
LID - 10.1021/bi801254c [doi]
AB  - FixL from Bradyrhizobium japonicum is a PAS sensor protein in which two PAS domains 
      covalently linked to a histidine kinase domain are responsible for regulating 
      nitrogen fixation in an oxygen-dependent manner. The more C-terminal PAS domain, 
      denoted bjFixLH, contains a heme cofactor that binds diatomic molecules such as 
      carbon monoxide and oxygen and regulates the activity of the FixL histidine kinase 
      as part of a two-component signaling system. We present the structures of ferric, 
      deoxy, and carbon monoxide-bound bjFixLH in a new space group ( P1) and at 
      resolutions (1.5-1.8 A) higher than the resolutions of those previously obtained. 
      Interestingly, bjFixLH can form two different dimers (in P1 and R32 crystal forms) 
      in the same crystallization solution, where the monomers in one dimer are rotated 
      approximately 175 degrees relative to the second. This suggests that PAS monomers 
      are plastic and that two quite distinct quaternary structures are closely similar in 
      free energy. We use screw rotation analysis to carry out a quantitative pairwise 
      comparison of PAS quaternary structures, which identifies five different relative 
      orientations adopted by isolated PAS monomers. We conclude that PAS monomer 
      arrangement is context-dependent and could differ depending on whether the PAS 
      domains are isolated or are part of a full-length protein. Structurally homologous 
      residues comprise a conserved dimer interface. Using network analysis, we find that 
      the architecture of the PAS dimer interface is continuous rather than modular; the 
      network of residues comprising the interface is strongly connected. A continuous 
      dimer interface is consistent with the low dimer-monomer dissociation equilibrium 
      constant. Finally, we quantitate quaternary structural changes induced by carbon 
      monoxide binding to a bjFixLH dimer, in which monomers rotate by up to approximately 
      2 degrees relative to each other. We relate these changes to those in other dimeric 
      PAS domains and discuss the role of quaternary structural changes in the signaling 
      mechanisms of PAS sensor proteins.

TI  - Characterization of the interactions of lysozyme with DNA by surface plasmon 
      resonance and circular dichroism spectroscopy.
PG  - 631-41
LID - 10.1007/s12010-008-8348-3 [doi]
AB  - Association with nucleic acid has been recognized as a unique role of lysozyme and 
      may explain why lysozyme was called a killer protein against HIV infection. In the 
      present study, we characterized the interactions of lysozyme and its derived 
      peptides with a biotin-labeled pUC19 plasmid DNA. Real-time detection of the 
      macromolecular interaction was performed using the SPR (surface plasmon resonance) 
      spectroscopy. The SPR sensorgrams were analyzed and the association and dissociation 
      rate constants as well as the dissociation equilibrium constant KD were, thus, 
      estimated. The results reveal that other than the electrostatic interactions between 
      the basic protein and the nucleotide sequences carrying negative charges, the 
      specific DNA-binding motifs at the N- and C-termini of lysozyme were also involved 
      in the interactions. The nonapeptide RAWVAWRNR (aa 107-115 of lysozyme) reported 
      previously to block HIV-1 viral entrance and replication was also able to bind DNA 
      with its KD value comparable to that of histones. The possibilities of 
      ligand-binding-induced conformational changes were investigated using the circular 
      dichroism spectroscopy. The CD spectra (200-320 nm) reveal that the conformational 
      changes indeed occur as the spectra of lysozyme-DNA interactions are much less at 
      the major trough region than the sum of individual spectra. The interaction of 
      lysozyme with DNA molecules may interfere with DNA replication, modulate gene 
      expression, and block bacterial and viral infections. These all suggest that human 
      lysozyme may represent part of the innate immune system with a very broad protective 
      spectrum.

PG  - 12881-7
LID - 10.1021/jp711544u [doi]
AB  - We present a study on lysozyme dissolved in mixtures of water and urea, which is 
      ubiquitously used as a protein denaturant. Despite the wide use of urea, the basic 
      molecular mechanisms inducing protein unfolding are not still clarified. Small-angle 
      neutron scattering (SANS) experiments have been performed using little amounts of 
      denaturant in solutions in order to investigate the urea effect on lysozyme 
      preceding the unfolding process. A global fit strategy, applied to analyze SANS 
      experiments, provides an estimation of the average composition of the solvent in the 
      close vicinity of the protein surface and the change of the protein-protein 
      interactions due to the presence of urea. In particular, the thermodynamic 
      equilibrium constant responsible for cosolvent balancing between the bulk and 
      solvation layer has been determined. It turns out that urea is preferentially driven 
      to the protein surface, confirming literature results at infinite dilute conditions. 
      SANS data also reveal a possible variation of the protein net charge as a function 
      of urea concentration, opening new perspectives and questions about the protein 
      surface architecture at the first stages of unfolding processes.

      been developed, in which strong solvation by tOMA.TFA (methyltrioctylammonium 
      trifluoroacetate) enables a high concentration of ascorbic acid to be applied, and 
      in which t-butanol enhances conversion by changing the equilibrium constant of the 
      activity coefficients. This work has experimentally demonstrated the practicability 
      of achieving efficient reactions of polar compounds at high concentrations in ionic 
      liquids without significant loss of enzyme activity.

AB  - We report on the effects of water activity and surrounding viscosity on electron 
      transfer reactions taking place within a membrane protein: the reaction center (RC) 
      from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter sphaeroides. We measured the kinetics 
      of charge recombination between the primary photoxidized donor (P(+)) and the 
      reduced quinone acceptors. Water activity (aW) and viscosity (eta) have been tuned 
      by changing the concentration of cosolutes (trehalose, sucrose, glucose, and 
      glycerol) and the temperature. The temperature dependence of the rate of charge 
      recombination between the reduced primary quinone, Q(A)(-), and P(+) was found to be 
      unaffected by the presence of cosolutes. At variance, the kinetics of charge 
      recombination between the reduced secondary quinone (Q(B)(-)) and P(+) was found to 
      be severely influenced by the presence of cosolutes and by the temperature. Results 
      collected over a wide eta-range (2 orders of magnitude) demonstrate that the rate of 
      P(+)Q(B)(-) recombination is uncorrelated to the solution viscosity. The kinetics of 
      P(+)Q(B)(-) recombination depends on the P(+)Q(A)(-)Q(B) <--> P(+)Q(A)Q(B)(-) 
      equilibrium constant. Accordingly, the dependence of the interquinone electron 
      transfer equilibrium constant on T and aW has been explained by assuming that the 
      transfer of one electron from Q(A)(-) to Q(B) is associated with the release of 
      about three water molecules by the RC. This implies that the interquinone electron 
      transfer involves at least two RC substates differing in the stoichiometry of 
      interacting water molecules.

      subtilisin Carlsberg.
PG  - 7388-93
LID - 10.1021/la8007014 [doi]
AB  - Adsorption and proteolytic activity of the enzyme subtilisin Carlsberg have been 
      studied on an immobilized, multilayer ovalbumin film. The cross-linked multilayer 
      substrate permits protease adsorption to be examined unencumbered by the surface 
      inhomogeneity typically observed in monolayer studies of protease surface kinetics. 
      Decline of the protein film was measured over time using ellipsometry. Resulting 
      kinetic data as a function of aqueous enzyme concentration and temperature were well 
      fit by a Langmuir-Michaelis-Menten model for surface proteolysis. We observed that 
      both the protein degradation kinetics and the in situ adsorption data were well 
      described by the proposed model. The temperature dependence of the kinetic rate 
      parameter yielded an activation energy of 12 kcal/mol. Further, the apparent 
      Langmuir adsorption equilibrium constant of the enzyme at the protein/aqueous 
      interface was 0.11 L/mg at 22 degrees C, 0.034 L/mg at 36 degrees C, and 0.011 L/mg 
      at 50 degrees C. Although enzyme adsorption at a given aqueous enzyme concentration 
      decreased at higher temperature, the enzyme cleaved the substrate more rapidly, 
      leading to a net increase in the ovalbumin film degradation rate. We observed that 
      the maximum enzyme coverage on the immobilized protein surface was approximately 40% 
      of a close-packed monolayer at ambient temperature (22 degrees C).

TI  - Comprehensive analysis of the metabolome of Pseudomonas putida S12 grown on 
      different carbon sources.
PG  - 315-27
LID - 10.1039/b717340g [doi]
AB  - Metabolomics is an emerging, powerful, functional genomics technology that involves 
      the comparative non-targeted analysis of the complete set of metabolites in an 
      organism. We have set-up a robust quantitative metabolomics platform that allows the 
      analysis of 'snapshot' metabolomes. In this study, we have applied this platform for 
      the comprehensive analysis of the metabolite composition of Pseudomonas putida S12 
      grown on four different carbon sources, i.e. fructose, glucose, gluconate and 
      succinate. This paper focuses on the microbial aspects of analyzing comprehensive 
      metabolomes, and demonstrates that metabolomes can be analyzed reliably. The 
      technical (i.e. sample work-up and analytical) reproducibility was on average 10%, 
      while the biological reproducibility was approximately 40%. Moreover, the energy 
      charge values of the microbial samples generated were determined, and indicated that 
      no biotic or abiotic changes had occurred during sample work-up and analysis. In 
      general, the metabolites present and their concentrations were very similar after 
      growth on the different carbon sources. However, specific metabolites showed large 
      differences in concentration, especially the intermediates involved in the 
      degradation of the carbon sources studied. Principal component discriminant analysis 
      was applied to identify metabolites that are specific for, i.e. not necessarily the 
      metabolites that show those largest differences in concentration, cells grown on 
      either of these four carbon sources. For selected enzymatic reactions, i.e. the 
      glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, triosephosphate isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase 
      reactions, the apparent equilibrium constants (K(app)) were calculated. In several 
      instances a carbon source-dependent deviation between the apparent equilibrium 
      constant (K(app)) and the thermodynamic equilibrium constant (K(eq)) was observed, 
      hinting towards a potential point of metabolic regulation or towards bottlenecks in 
      biosynthesis routes. For glucose-6-phosphate isomerase and phosphoglyceromutase, the 
      K(app) was larger than K(eq), and the results suggested that the specific enzymatic 
      activities of these two enzymes were too low to reach the thermodynamic equilibrium 
      in growing cells. In contrast, with triosephosphate isomerase the K(app) was smaller 
      than K(eq), and the results suggested that this enzyme is kinetically controlled.

AB  - The compulsory-ordered ternary catalytic mechanism for two-substrate two-product 
      enzymes is analyzed to account for binding of inhibitors to each of the four enzyme 
      states and to maintain the relationship between the kinetic constants and the 
      reaction equilibrium constant. The developed quasi-steady flux expression is applied 
      to the analysis of data from citrate synthase to determine and parameterize a 
      kinetic scheme in terms of biochemical species, in which the effects of pH, ionic 
      strength, and cation binding to biochemical species are explicitly accounted for in 
      the analysis of the data. This analysis provides a mechanistic model that is 
      consistent with the data that have been used support competing hypotheses regarding 
      the catalytic mechanism of this enzyme.

TI  - Kinetic model for the coupling between allosteric transitions in GroEL and substrate 
      protein folding and aggregation.
PG  - 1279-95
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2008.01.059 [doi]
AB  - The bacterial chaperonin GroEL and the co-chaperonin GroES assist in the folding of 
      a number of structurally unrelated substrate proteins (SPs). In the absence of 
      chaperonins, SP folds by the kinetic partitioning mechanism (KPM), according to 
      which a fraction of unfolded molecules reaches the native state directly, while the 
      remaining fraction gets trapped in a potentially aggregation-prone misfolded state. 
      During the catalytic reaction cycle, GroEL undergoes a series of allosteric 
      transitions (T<-->R-->R"-->T) triggered by SP capture, ATP binding and hydrolysis, 
      and GroES binding. We developed a general kinetic model that takes into account the 
      coupling between the rates of the allosteric transitions and the folding and 
      aggregation of the SP. Our model, in which the GroEL allosteric rates and 
      SP-dependent folding and aggregation rates are independently varied without prior 
      assumption, quantitatively fits the GroEL concentration-dependent data on the yield 
      of native ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) as a function of 
      time. The extracted kinetic parameters for the GroEL reaction cycle are consistent 
      with the available values from independent experiments. In addition, we also 
      obtained physically reasonable parameters for the kinetic steps in the reaction 
      cycle that are difficult to measure. If experimental values for GroEL allosteric 
      rates are used, the time-dependent changes in native-state yield at eight GroEL 
      concentrations can be quantitatively fit using only three SP-dependent parameters. 
      The model predicts that the differences in the efficiencies (as measured by yields 
      of the native state) of GroEL, single-ring mutant (SR1), and variants of SR1, in the 
      rescue of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and Rubisco, are 
      related to the large variations in the allosteric transition rates. We also show 
      that GroEL/S mutants that efficiently fold one SP at the expense of all others are 
      due to a decrease in the rate of a key step in the reaction cycle, which implies 
      that wild-type GroEL has evolved as a compromise between generality and specificity. 
      We predict that, under maximum loading conditions and saturating ATP concentration, 
      the efficiency of GroEL (using parameters for Rubisco) depends predominantly on the 
      rate of R-->R" transition, while the equilibrium constant of the T<-->R has a small 
      effect only. Both under sub- and superstoichiometric GroEL concentrations, enhanced 
      efficiency is achieved by rapid turnover of the reaction cycle, which is in accord 
      with the predictions of the iterative annealing mechanism. The effects are most 
      dramatic at substoichiometric conditions (most relevant for in vivo situations) when 
      SP aggregation can outcompete capture of SP by chaperonins.

AB  - The epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR) is overexpressed in various 
      malignancies and is associated with a poor patient prognosis. A small, 
      receptor-specific, high-affinity imaging agent would be a useful tool in diagnosing 
      malignant tumors and in deciding upon treatment and assessing the response to 
      treatment. We describe here the affinity maturation procedure for the generation of 
      Affibody molecules binding with high affinity and specificity to EGFR. A library for 
      affinity maturation was constructed by rerandomization of selected positions after 
      the alignment of first-generation binding variants. New binders were selected with 
      phage display technology, using a single oligonucleotide in a single-library effort, 
      and the best second-generation binders had an approximately 30-fold improvement in 
      affinity (K(d)=5-10 nM) for the soluble extracellular domain of EGFR in biospecific 
      interaction analysis using Biacore. The dissociation equilibrium constant, K(d), was 
      also determined for the Affibody with highest affinity using EGFR-expressing A431 
      cells in flow cytometric analysis (K(d)=2.8 nM). A retained high specificity for 
      EGFR was verified by a dot blot assay showing staining only of EGFR proteins among a 
      panel of serum proteins and other EGFR family member proteins (HER2, HER3, and 
      HER4). The EGFR-binding Affibody molecules were radiolabeled with indium-111, 
      showing specific binding to EGFR-expressing A431 cells and successful targeting of 
      the A431 tumor xenografts with 4-6% injected activity per gram accumulated in the 
      tumor 4 h postinjection.

TI  - Late steps in the formation of E. coli RNA polymerase-lambda P R promoter open

      experiments.
PG  - 1034-47
LID - 10.1016/j.jmb.2007.11.064 [doi]
AB  - The formation of the transcriptionally competent open complex (RP(o)) by Escherichia 
      coli RNA polymerase at the lambda P(R) promoter involves at least three steps and 
      two kinetically significant intermediates (I(1) and I(2)). Understanding the 
      sequence of conformational changes (rearrangements in the jaws of RNA polymerase, 
      DNA opening) that occur in the conversion of I(1) to RP(o) requires: (1) dissecting 
      the rate constant k(d) for the dissociation of RP(o) into contributions from 
      individual steps and (2) isolating and characterizing I(2). To deconvolute k(d), we 
      develop experiments involving rapid upshifts to elevated concentrations of 
      RP(o)-destabilizing solutes ("perturbants": urea and KCl) to create a burst in the 
      population of I(2). At high concentrations of either perturbant, k(d) approaches the 
      same [perturbant]-independent value, interpreted as the elementary rate constant 
      k(-2) for I(2)-->I(1). The large effects of [urea] and [salt] on K(3) (the 
      equilibrium constant for I(2) is in equilibrium with RP(o)) indicate that a 
      large-scale folding transition in polymerase occurs and a new interface with the DNA 
      forms late in the mechanism. We deduce that I(2) at the lambda P(R) promoter is 
      always unstable relative to RP(o), even at 0 degrees C, explaining previous 
      difficulties in detecting it by using temperature downshifts. The division of the 
      large positive enthalpy change between the late steps of the mechanism suggests that 
      an additional unstable intermediate (I(3)) may exist between I(2) and RP(o).

TI  - Heterogeneity in EGF-binding affinities arises from negative cooperativity in an 
      aggregating system.
PG  - 112-7
LID - 10.1073/pnas.0707080105 [doi]
AB  - Scatchard analysis of the binding of EGF to its receptor yields concave up plots 
      that indicate the presence of two classes of binding sites. However, how two 
      independent classes of sites arise from the expression of a single EGF receptor 
      protein has never been adequately explained. Using a new analytical approach 
      involving the simultaneous fitting of binding isotherms from cells expressing 
      increasing levels of EGF receptors, we show that (125)I-EGF-binding data can be 
      completely explained by a model involving negative cooperativity in an aggregating 
      system. This approach provides an experimentally determined value for the 
      monomer-dimer equilibrium constant, which, for wild-type EGF receptors, corresponds 
      to approximately 50,000 receptors per cell. Therefore, changes in receptor 
      expression within the physiological range can modulate the outcome of a signaling 
      stimulus. Analysis of the L680N-EGF receptor mutant, in which the formation of 
      asymmetric kinase domain dimers is blocked, indicates that the kinase dimers make a 
      substantial energetic contribution to the ligand-independent association of EGF 
      receptor monomers, but are not necessary for negative cooperativity. The model 
      accurately predicts the behavior of receptor mutants, such as the 
      dimerization-defective Y246D-EGF receptor, which exhibit a single class of binding 
      sites and provides a framework for understanding secondary dimer formation and 
      lateral signaling in the EGF receptor family.

TI  - Enzymic approach to eurythermalism of Alvinella pompejana and its episymbionts.
PG  - 774-82
AB  - The equilibrium model, which describes the influence of temperature on enzyme 
      activity, has been established as a valid and useful tool for characterizing enzyme 
      eurythermalism and thermophily. By introducing K(eq), a temperature-dependent 
      equilibrium constant for the interconversion between E(act), the active form of 
      enzyme, and E(inact), a reversibly inactive form of enzyme, the equilibrium model 
      currently provides the most complete description of the enzyme-temperature 
      relationship; its derived parameters are intrinsic and apparently universal and, 
      being derived under reaction conditions, potentially have physiological 
      significance. One of these parameters, T(eq), correlates with host growth 
      temperature better than enzyme stability does. The vent-dwelling annelid Alvinella 
      pompejana has been reported as an extremely eurythermal organism, and the symbiotic 
      complex microbial community associated with its dorsal surface is likely to 
      experience similar environmental thermal conditions. The A. pompejana episymbiont 
      community, predominantly composed of epsilonproteobacteria, has been analyzed 
      metagenomically, enabling direct retrieval of genes coding for enzymes suitable for 
      equilibrium model applications. Two such genes, coding for isopropylmalate 
      dehydrogenase and glutamate dehydrogenase, have been isolated from the A. pompejana 
      episymbionts, heterologously expressed, and shown by reverse 
      transcription-quantitative PCR to be actively expressed. The equilibrium model 
      parameters of characterized expression products suggested that enzyme eurythermalism 
      constitutes part of the thermal adaptation strategy employed by the episymbionts. 
      Moreover, the enzymes' thermal characteristics correspond to their predicted 
      physiological roles and the abundance and expression of the corresponding genes. 
      This paper demonstrates the use of the equilibrium model as part of a top-down 
      metagenomic approach to studying temperature adaptation of uncultured organisms.

TI  - Fluorimetric study of interaction of merbromin with trypsin.
PG  - 1109-13
AB  - Interaction of merbromin with trypsin is of bovine origin has been studied by 
      monitoring the absorption steady-state and time-resolved fluorescence spectral 
      properties of the dye. Studies have been done in media of varying pH at different 
      trypsin concentrations. It has been observed that trypsin brings about a quenching 
      of fluorescence of the dye. The quenching is static in nature and the equilibrium 
      constant of dye-trypsin interaction in the ground-state has been determined from 
      quenching studies. Steady-state anisotropy of the dye increases in presence of 
      trypsin in the medium. Values of micro-viscosity in the vicinity of the fluorophore 
      in media containing trypsin have been determined from measurements of fluorescence 
      anisotropy. Time-resolved fluorescence studies indicate the existence of two 
      decaying states for the dye. The fractional contribution to the time-resolved decay 
      changes with pH. The average lifetime, however, does not depend on the concentration 
      of trypsin.

TI  - Rapid-equilibrium rate equations for the enzymatic catalysis of A+B=P+Q over a range 
      of pH.
PG  - 114-26
AB  - This article shows how pKs for the enzymatic site and enzyme-substrate complexes can 
      be obtained from kinetic experiments on the reaction A+B=P+Q, with and without the 
      consumption of hydrogen ions. The rapid-equilibrium rate equation makes it possible 
      to obtain the pKs and chemical equilibrium constants involved in the mechanism, the 
      apparent equilibrium constant K' for the catalyzed reaction, and the number of 
      hydrogen ions consumed in the rate-determining reaction. Experimentally-determined 
      Michaelis constants can be adjusted for the pKs of the substrates A, B, P, and Q so 
      that it is easier to obtain the pKs of E, EA, EB, EAB, EQ, and EPQ, and the chemical 
      equilibrium constants. Reaction rates are discussed for the forward reaction ordered 
      A+B=ordered P+Q with zero, one, or two hydrogen ions consumed in the 
      rate-determining reaction and for random A+B=ordered P+Q with zero, one, or two 
      hydrogen ions consumed in the rate-determining reaction. When hydrogen ions are 
      consumed in the rate-determining reaction, there is a new factor 10(n)(pH) in the 
      rate equation, where n is the number of hydrogen ions consumed in the 
      rate-determining reaction for the forward reaction. The integer n can be obtained 
      from rate measurements over a range of pH, but it cannot be determined from 
      thermodynamic measurements.

TI  - Molecular coevolution of the vertebrate cytochrome c(1) and Rieske iron sulphur 
      protein in the cytochrome bc(1) complex.
PG  - 456-70
AB  - Cytochrome c(1) (cyt-c(1)) and the Rieske Iron Sulphur Protein (ISP) are subunits of 
      the cytochrome bc(1) complex located in the mitochondria functioning both as a 
      proton pump and an electron transporter. Vertebrate model organism phylogenies were 
      used in conjunction with existing 3D protein structures to evaluate the biochemical 
      evolution of cyt-c(1) and ISP in terms of selection on amino acid properties. We 
      found selection acting on the exterior surfaces of both proteins and specifically 
      the core region of cyt-c(1). There is evidence supporting coevolution of these 
      proteins relative to alpha helical tendencies, compressibility and equilibrium 
      constant.

TI  - Effect of the pretreatment of lipase with organic solvents on its conformation and 
      activity in reverse micelles.
PG  - 253-62
AB  - The activity and conformation of Chromobacterium viscosum lipase-pretreated with 
      various organic solvents were investigated. The pretreatment of lipase led to a 
      substantial increase of enzyme activity in AOT (sodium bis [2-ethyl -1-hexyl] 
      sulfosuccinate)/isooctane/water reverse micelles. Among the organic solvents used, 
      n-hexane was found to be most effective. It was observed that higher hexane content 
      with shorter agitation time and vice versa had almost the same effect on the initial 
      activity of lipase. The kinetic study showed that the Michaelis constant (K m) and 
      the substrate adsorption equilibrium constant (K ad) were reduced by the 
      pretreatment of lipase with hexane, whereas the change in the maximum reaction rate 
      (V max) was insignificant. The two spectroscopic techniques (Fluorescence spectra of 
      lipase encapsulated in RMs and Fourier transform infrared [FTIR] spectra of lipase 
      powders) were performed to detect possible conformational changes in the enzyme 
      caused by the pretreatment. A correlation between the maximum fluorescence intensity 
      and the activity of treated lipase was found as a function of agitation time. The 
      FTIR spectrum of lipase showed a new shape peak corresponding to 1,500 cm-1 as a 
      result of pretreatment with organic solvents.

TI  - Detection of high- and low-affinity antibodies against a human monoclonal antibody 
      using various technology platforms.
PG  - 655-62
AB  - The effect of monoclonal antibody (mAb) affinity on the detection limit of 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), surface plasmon resonance (SPR), and 
      electrochemiluminescence (ECL) methods was evaluated using a panel of murine mAbs 
      with affinities ranging from 0.057 to 340 nM. M1 and M7 are anti-idiotypic mAbs 
      against a human mAb, ABX10, with dissociation equilibrium constant (KD) values of 
      0.057 and 7.2 nM, respectively. HP6030 and HP6002 are anti human IgG mAbs with KD 
      values of 30 and 340 nM, respectively. The limit of detection (LOD) for these mAbs 
      was determined using ELISA, SPR, and ECL technologies and was generally correlated 
      with the rank order of their affinities. The LODs for M1, M7, HP6030, and HP6002 by 
      ELISA were 17 +/- 13, 26,000 +/- 9,020, 344,000 +/- 271,000, and 792,000 +/- 
      1,050,000 ng/ml, respectively. According to an industry-suggested detection limit of 
      500 ng/ml, the ELISA was not sensitive enough for detecting M7, HP6030, and HP6002, 
      demonstrating its limitation for detection of low- affinity mAbs. The SPR method 
      lowered the LOD for M7 to 3,900 ng/ml, which was above the industry requirement. The 
      ECL method lowered the LOD for all antibodies tested. Importantly, the ECL method 
      lowered the LOD for M7 to 570 +/- 370 ng/ml, which is close to the industry 
      requirement. Since the ECL method had demonstrated a high serum tolerance, its 
      detection capability may be improved by using a higher percentage of serum in the 
      assay matrix. Although a hook effect was observed with ECL methods, the methods 
      could still detect anti-drug antibody (ADA) concentrations greater than 1 mg/ml, 
      which minimizes concerns that high-titer ADA responses could be missed. The results 
      demonstrated the superiority of an ECL method in detecting high- and low- affinity 
      antibodies when compared to the ELISA and SPR methods.

AB  - Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases (HSDs) are essential for the biosynthesis and 
      mechanism of action of all steroid hormones. We report the complete kinetic 
      mechanism of a mammalian HSD using rat 3alpha-HSD of the aldo-keto reductase 
      superfamily (AKR1C9) with the substrate pairs androstane-3,17-dione and NADPH 
      (reduction) and androsterone and NADP(+) (oxidation). Steady-state, transient state 
      kinetics, and kinetic isotope effects reconciled the ordered bi-bi mechanism, which 
      contained 9 enzyme forms and permitted the estimation of 16 kinetic constants. In 
      both reactions, loose association of the NADP(H) was followed by two conformational 
      changes, which increased cofactor affinity by >86-fold. For androstane-3,17-dione 
      reduction, the release of NADP(+) controlled k(cat), whereas the chemical event also 
      contributed to this term. k(cat) was insensitive to [(2)H]NADPH, whereas 
      (D)k(cat)/K(m) and the (D)k(lim) (ratio of the maximum rates of single turnover) 
      were 1.06 and 2.06, respectively. Under multiple turnover conditions partial burst 
      kinetics were observed. For androsterone oxidation, the rate of NADPH release 
      dominated k(cat), whereas the rates of the chemical event and the release of 
      androstane-3,17-dione were 50-fold greater. Under multiple turnover conditions full 
      burst kinetics were observed. Although the internal equilibrium constant favored 
      oxidation, the overall K(eq) favored reduction. The kinetic Haldane and free energy 
      diagram confirmed that K(eq) was governed by ligand binding terms that favored the 
      reduction reactants. Thus, HSDs in the aldo-keto reductase superfamily 
      thermodynamically favor ketosteroid reduction.

TI  - Modeling the haloperoxidases: reversible oxygen atom transfer between bromide ion 
      and an oxo-Mn(V) porphyrin.
PG  - 1786-97
AB  - The manganese meso-dimethylimidazolium porphyrin complex Mn(III)[TDMImP] reacted 
      with HOBr/OBr(-) to generate the corresponding oxo-Mn(V)[TDMImP] species. The rate 
      of this process accelerated with increasing pH. A forward rate constant, k(for), of 
      1.65x10(6)M(-1)s(-1) was determined at pH 8. Under these conditions, the oxo-Mn(V) 
      species is short-lived and is transformed into the corresponding oxo-Mn(IV) complex. 
      A first-order rate constant, k(obs), of 0.66 s(-1) was found for this reduction 
      process at pH 8. The mechanism of this reduction process, which was dependent on 
      bromide ion, appeared to proceed via an intermediate Mn(III)-O-Br complex. Thus, 
      both a fast, reversible Mn(III)-O-Br bond heterolysis and a slower homolytic pathway 
      occur in parallel in this system. The reverse oxidation reaction between 
      oxo-Mn(V)[TDMImP] and bromide was investigated as a function of pH. The rate of this 
      oxo-transfer reaction (k(rev)=1.4x10(3)M(-1)s(-1) at pH 8) markedly accelerated as 
      the pH was lowered. The observed first-order dependence of the rate on [H(+)] 
      indicates that the reactive species responsible for bromide oxidation is a 
      protonated oxo-hydroxo complex and the stable species present in solution at high pH 
      is dioxo-Mn(V)[TDMImP], [O=Mn(V)=O](-). The oxo-Mn(V) species retains nearly all of 
      the oxidative driving force of the hypohalite. The equilibrium constant 
      K(equi)=k(for)/k(rev) for the reversible process was determined at three different 
      pH values (K(equi)=1.15x10(3) at pH 8) allowing the measurement of the redox 
      potentials E of oxo-Mn(V)/Mn(III) (E=1.01 V at pH 8). The redox potential for this 
      couple was extrapolated over the entire pH scale using the Nernst relationship and 
      compared to those of the manganese 2- and 4-meso-N-methylpyridinium porphyrin 
      couples oxo-Mn(V)[2-TMPyP]/Mn(III)[2-TMPyP], oxo-Mn(V)[4-TMPyP]/Mn(III)[4-TMPyP], 
      OBr(-)/Br(-) and H(2)O(2)/H(2)O. Notably, the redox potential of oxo-Mn(V)/Mn(III) 
      for the imidazolium porphyrin approaches that of H(2)O(2)/H(2)O at low pH.

TI  - Adsorption equilibrium of fructosyltransferase on a weak anion-exchange resin.
PG  - 56-61
AB  - The adsorption equilibrium of a glycoprotein, fructosyltransferase from 
      Aureobasidium pullulans, on an anion-exchange resin, Sepabeads FP-DA activated with 
      0.1M NaOH, was investigated. The adsorption isotherms were determined at 20 degrees 
      C in a phosphate-citrate buffer with pH 6.0 using the static method. Sodium chloride 
      was used to adjust the ionic strength in the range from 0.0215 to 0.1215 mol dm(-3) 
      which provided conditions varying from a weak effect of salt concentration on 
      protein binding to its strong suppression. The equilibrium data were very well 
      fitted by means of the steric mass-action model when the ion-exchange capacity of 
      290 mmol dm(-3) was obtained from independent frontal column experiments. The model

      0.326, and steric factor 1.095 x 10(5).

TI  - A solution NMR study showing that active site ligands and nucleotides directly 
      perturb the allosteric equilibrium in aspartate transcarbamoylase.
PG  - 8815-20
AB  - The 306-kDa aspartate transcarbamoylase is a well studied regulatory enzyme, and it 
      has emerged as a paradigm for understanding allostery and cooperative binding 
      processes. Although there is a consensus that the cooperative binding of active site 
      ligands follows the Monod-Wyman-Changeux (MWC) model of allostery, there is some 
      debate about the binding of effectors such as ATP and CTP and how they influence the 
      allosteric equilibrium between R and T states of the enzyme. In this article, the 
      binding of substrates, substrate analogues, and nucleotides is studied, along with 
      their effect on the R-T equilibrium by using highly deuterated, 
      (1)H,(13)C-methyl-labeled protein in concert with methyl-transverse relaxation 
      optimized spectroscopy (TROSY) NMR. Although only the T state of the enzyme can be 
      observed in spectra of wild-type unliganded aspartate transcarbamoylase, binding of 
      active-site substrates shift the equilibrium so that correlations from the R state 
      become visible, allowing the equilibrium constant (L') between ligand-saturated R 
      and T forms of the enzyme to be measured quantitatively. The equilibrium constant 
      between unliganded R and T forms (L) also is obtained, despite the fact that the R 
      state is "invisible" in spectra, by means of an indirect process that makes use of 
      relations that emerge from the fact that ligand binding and the R-T equilibrium are 
      linked. Titrations with MgATP unequivocally establish that its binding directly 
      perturbs the R-T equilibrium, consistent with the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model. This 
      study emphasizes the utility of modern solution NMR spectroscopy in understanding 
      protein function, even for systems with aggregate molecular masses in the hundreds 
      of kilodaltons.

TI  - Two different ways that hydrogen ions are involved in the thermodynamics and 
      rapid-equilibrium kinetics of the enzymatic catalysis of S=P and S+H2O=P.
PG  - 204-9
AB  - Hydrogen ions are involved in two different ways in the thermodynamics and 
      rapid-equilibrium kinetics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The two ways are through 
      pKs and through the production or consumption of hydrogen ions in the mechanism. 
      These ways are examined for the catalyzed reactions S=P and S+H2O=P. Since the 
      apparent equilibrium constant K' can be calculated from the kinetic parameters by 
      use of the Haldane equation, the treatment of the effects of pH must be consistent 
      in thermodynamics and kinetics. This leads to a new kind of Haldane equation that 
      involves 10(pH) or 10(-pH) in addition to the kinetic parameters when hydrogen ions 
      are produced or consumed. These concepts are applicable to more complicated 
      reactions and rate equations. Derivations of equations for calculating these two 
      types of pH effects are discussed in thermodynamics and rapid-equilibrium kinetics. 
      A computer program is used to make four plots of apparent equilibrium constants and 
      changes in the binding of hydrogen ions in the catalyzed reaction.

TI  - Recognized sequence and conformation in design of linear peptides as a competitive 
      inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase.
PG  - 197-203
AB  - This study is an attempt to develop a simple search method for lead peptide 
      candidates, which include constrained structures in a recognized sequence, using the 
      design of a competitive inhibitor for HMG-CoA reductase (HMGR). A 
      structure-functional analysis of previously synthesized peptides proposes that a 
      competitive inhibitory peptide can be designed by maintaining bioactive conformation 
      in a recognized sequence. A conformational aspect of the structure-based approach 
      was applied to the peptide design. By analysis of the projections obtained through a 
      principle component analysis (PCA) for short linear and cyclic peptides, a 
      head-to-tail peptide cycle is considered as a model for its linear analogy. It is 
      proposed that activities of the linear peptides based on an identical amino acid 
      sequence, which are obtained from a less flexible peptide cycle, would be relatively 
      higher than those obtained from more flexible cyclic peptides. The design criterion 
      was formulated in terms of a 'V' parameter, reflecting a relative deviation of an 
      individual peptide cycle from an average statistical peptide cycle based on all 
      optimized structures of the cyclic peptides in set. Twelve peptide cycles were 
      selected for the peptide library. Comparing the calculated 'V' parameters, two 
      cyclic peptides (GLPTGG and GFPTGG) were selected as lead cycles from the library. 
      Based on these sequences, six linear peptides obtained by breaking the cycle at 
      different positions were selected as lead peptide candidates. The linear GFPTGG 
      peptide, showing the highest inhibitory activity against HMGR, increases the 
      inhibitory potency nearly tenfold. Kinetic analysis reveals that the GFPTGG peptide 
      is a competitive inhibitor of HMG-CoA with an equilibrium constant of inhibitor 
      binding (K(i)) of 6.4 +/- 0.3 microM. Conformational data support a conformation of 
      the designed peptides close to the bioactive conformation of the previously 
      synthesized active peptides.

TI  - Selective perturbation of the myosin recovery stroke by point mutations at the base 
      of the lever arm affects ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release.
PG  - 17658-64
AB  - After ATP binding the myosin head undergoes a large structural rearrangement called 
      the recovery stroke. This transition brings catalytic residues into place to enable 
      ATP hydrolysis, and at the same time it causes a swing of the myosin lever arm into 
      a primed state, which is a prerequisite for the power stroke. By introducing point 
      mutations into a subdomain interface at the base of the myosin lever arm at 
      positions Lys(84) and Arg(704), we caused modulatory changes in the equilibrium 
      constant of the recovery stroke, which we could accurately resolve using the 
      fluorescence signal of single tryptophan Dictyostelium myosin II constructs. Our 
      results shed light on a novel role of the recovery stroke: fine-tuning of this 
      reversible equilibrium influences the functional properties of myosin through 
      controlling the effective rates of ATP hydrolysis and phosphate release.

TI  - 15N nuclear magnetic resonance studies of acid-base properties of 
      pyridoxal-5'-phosphate aldimines in aqueous solution.
PG  - 3869-76
AB  - By use of 15N NMR spectroscopy, we have measured the pKa values of the aldimines 
      15N-(pyridoxyl-5'-phosphate-idine)-methylamine (2a), 
      N-(pyridoxyl-5'-phosphate-15N-idine)-methylamine (2b), and 
      15N-(pyridoxyl-idine)-methylamine (3). These aldimines model the cofactor 
      pyridoxal-5'-phosphate (PLP, 1) in a variety of PLP-dependent enzymes. The acid-base 
      properties of the aldimines differ substantially from those of the free cofactor in 
      the aldehyde form 1a or in the hydrated form 1b, which were also investigated using 
      15N NMR for comparison. All compounds contain three protonation sites, the pyridine 
      ring, the phenol group, and the side chain phosphate (1, 2) or hydroxyl group (3). 
      In agreement with the literature, 1a exhibits one of several pKas at 2.9 and 1b at 
      4.2. The 15N chemical shifts indicate that the corresponding deprotonation occurs 
      partially in the pyridine and partially in the phenolic site, which compete for the 
      remaining proton. The equilibrium constant of this ring-phenolate tautomerism was 
      measured to be 0.40 for 1a and 0.06 for 1b. The tautomerism is essentially unaltered 
      above pH 6.1, where the phosphate group is deprotonated to the dianion. This means 
      that the pyridine ring is more basic than the phenolate group. Pyridine nitrogen 
      deprotonation occurs at 8.2 for 1a and at 8.7 for 1b. By contrast, above pH 4 the 
      phosphate site of 2 is deprotonated, while the pyridine ring pKa is 5.8. The Schiff 
      base nitrogen does not deprotonate below pH 11.4. When the phosphate group is 
      removed, the pKa of the Schiff base nitrogen decreases to 10.5. The phenol site 
      cannot compete for the proton of the Schiff base nitrogen and is present in the 
      entire pH range as a phenolate, preferentially hydrogen bonded to the solvent. The 
      intrinsic 15N chemical shifts provide information about the hydrogen bond structures 
      of the protonated and unprotonated species involved. Evidence is presented that the 
      intramolecular OHN hydrogen bond of PLP aldimines is broken in aqueous solution. The 
      coupling between the inter- and intramolecular OHN hydrogen bonds is also lost in 
      this environment. The pyridine ring of the PLP aldimines is not protonated in 
      aqueous solution near neutral pH. The basicity of the aldimine nitrogens would be 
      even lower without the doubly negatively charged phosphate group. Protonation of 
      both the Schiff base and pyridine nitrogens has been discussed as a prerequisite for 
      catalytic activity, and the implications of the present findings for PLP catalysis 
      are discussed.

TI  - Single-molecule measurements of the opening and closing of the DNA gate by 
      eukaryotic topoisomerase II.
PG  - 4840-5
AB  - Type II DNA topoisomerases are essential and ubiquitous enzymes that perform 
      important functions in chromosome condensation and segregation and in regulating 
      intracellular DNA supercoiling. Topoisomerases carry out these DNA transactions by 
      passing one segment of DNA through the other by using a reversible, enzyme-bridged 
      double strand break. The transient enzyme/DNA adduct is mediated by a phosphodiester 
      bond between the active-site tyrosine and a backbone phosphate of DNA. The opening 
      and closing of the DNA gate, a critical step for strand passage during the catalytic 
      cycle, is coupled to this cleavage/religation. We designed a unique oligonucleotide 
      substrate with a pair of fluorophores straddling the topoisomerase II cleavage site, 
      allowing the use of FRET to monitor the opening of the DNA gate. The DNA substrate 
      undergoes an enzyme-mediated transition between a closed and open state in the 
      presence of ATP, similar to the overall topoisomerase II catalyzed reaction. 
      Single-molecule fluorescence microscopy measurements demonstrate that the transition 
      has comparable rate constants for both the opening and closing reaction during 
      steady-state ATP hydrolysis, with an apparent equilibrium constant near unity. In 
      the presence of AMPPNP, a reduction in FRET occurs, suggesting an opening or partial 
      opening of the DNA gate. However, the single-molecule experiments indicate that the 
      open and closed states do not interconvert at a measurable rate.

TI  - Tenascin cytotactin epidermal growth factor-like repeat binds epidermal growth 
      factor receptor with low affinity.
PG  - 748-58
AB  - Select epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like (EGFL) repeats of human tenascin 
      cytotactin (tenascin C) can stimulate EGF receptor (EGFR) signaling, but activation 
      requires micromolar concentrations of soluble EGFL repeats in contrast to 
      subnanomolar concentrations of classical growth factors such as EGF. Using in silico 
      homology modeling techniques, we generated a structure for one such repeat, the 14th 
      EGFL repeat (Ten14). Ten14 assumes a tight EGF-like fold with truncated loops, 
      consistent with circular dichroism studies. We generated bound structures for Ten14 
      with EGFR using two different approaches, resulting in two distinctly different 
      conformations. Normal mode analysis of both structures indicated that the binding 
      pocket of EGFR exhibits a significantly higher mobility in Ten14-EGFR complex 
      compared to that of the EGF-EGFR complex; we hypothesized this may be attributed to 
      loss of key high-affinity interactions within the Ten14-EGFR complex. We proved the 
      efficacy of our in silico models by in vitro experiments. Surface plasmon resonance 
      measurements yielded equilibrium constant K(D) of 74 microM for Ten14, approximately 
      three orders of magnitude weaker than that of EGF. In accordance with our predicted 
      bound models, Ten14 in monomeric form does not bind EGFR with sufficient stability 
      so as to induce degradation of receptor, or undergo EGFR-mediated internalization 
      over either the short (20 min) or long (48 h) term. This transient interaction with 
      the receptor on the cell surface is in marked contrast to other EGFR ligands which 
      cause EGFR transit through, and signaling from intracellular locales in addition to 
      cell surface signaling.

TI  - Slow conformational dynamics of the guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras complexed 
      with the GTP analogue GTPgammaS.
PG  - 1419-33
AB  - The guanine nucleotide-binding protein Ras occurs in solution in two different 
      conformational states, state 1 and state 2 with an equilibrium constant K(12) of 
      2.0, when the GTP analogue guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-imido)triphosphate or 
      guanosine-5'-(beta,gamma-methyleno)triphosphate is bound to the active centre. State 
      2 is assumed to represent a strong binding state for effectors with a conformation 
      similar to that found for Ras complexed to effectors. In the other state (state 1), 
      the switch regions of Ras are most probably dynamically disordered. Ras variants 
      that exist predominantly in state 1 show a drastically reduced affinity to 
      effectors. In contrast, Ras(wt) bound to the GTP analogue 
      guanosine-5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) (GTPgammaS) leads to (31)P NMR spectra that 
      indicate the prevalence of only one conformational state with K(12) > 10. Titration 
      with the Ras-binding domain of Raf-kinase (Raf-RBD) shows that this state 
      corresponds to effector binding state 2. In the GTPgammaS complex of the effector 
      loop mutants Ras(T35S) and Ras(T35A) two conformational states different to state 2 
      are detected, which interconvert over a millisecond time scale. Binding studies with 
      Raf-RBD suggest that both mutants exist mainly in low-affinity states 1a and 1b. 
      From line-shape analysis of the spectra measured at various temperatures an 
      activation energy DeltaH(|) (1a1b) of 61 kJ.mol(-1) and an activation entropy 
      DeltaS(|) (1a1b) of 65 J.K(-1).mol(-1) are derived. Isothermal titration calorimetry 
      on Ras bound to the different GTP-analogues shows that the effective affinity K(A) 
      for the Raf-RBD to Ras(T35S) is reduced by a factor of about 20 compared to the 
      wild-type with the strongest reduction observed for the GTPgammaS complex.

TI  - Reversible movement of switch 1 loop of myosin determines actin interaction.
PG  - 265-74
AB  - The conserved switch 1 loop of P-loop NTPases is implicated as a central element 
      that transmits information between the nucleotide-binding pocket and the binding 
      site of the partner proteins. Recent structural studies have identified two states 
      of switch 1 in G-proteins and myosin, but their role in the transduction mechanism 
      has yet to be clarified. Single tryptophan residues were introduced into the switch 
      1 region of myosin II motor domain and studied by rapid reaction methods. We found 
      that in the presence of MgADP, two states of switch 1 exist in dynamic equilibrium. 
      Actin binding shifts the equilibrium towards one of the MgADP states, whereas ATP 
      strongly favors the other. In the light of electron cryo-microscopic and X-ray 
      crystallographic results, these findings lead to a specific structural model in 
      which the equilibrium constant between the two states of switch 1 is coupled to the 
      strength of the actin-myosin interaction. This has implications for the enzymatic 
      mechanism of G-proteins and possibly P-loop NTPases in general.

TI  - The dependence of enzyme activity on temperature: determination and validation of 
      parameters.
PG  - 331-7
AB  - Traditionally, the dependence of enzyme activity on temperature has been described 
      by a model consisting of two processes: the catalytic reaction defined by 
      DeltaG(Dagger)(cat), and irreversible inactivation defined by DeltaG(Dagger)(inact). 
      However, such a model does not account for the observed temperature-dependent 
      behaviour of enzymes, and a new model has been developed and validated. This model 
      (the Equilibrium Model) describes a new mechanism by which enzymes lose activity at 
      high temperatures, by including an inactive form of the enzyme (E(inact)) that is in 
      reversible equilibrium with the active form (E(act)); it is the inactive form that 
      undergoes irreversible thermal inactivation to the thermally denatured state. This 
      equilibrium is described by an equilibrium constant whose temperature-dependence is 
      characterized in terms of the enthalpy of the equilibrium, DeltaH(eq), and a new 
      thermal parameter, T(eq), which is the temperature at which the concentrations of 
      E(act) and E(inact) are equal; T(eq) may therefore be regarded as the thermal 
      equivalent of K(m). Characterization of an enzyme with respect to its 
      temperature-dependent behaviour must therefore include a determination of these 
      intrinsic properties. The Equilibrium Model has major implications for enzymology, 
      biotechnology and understanding the evolution of enzymes. The present study presents 
      a new direct data-fitting method based on fitting progress curves directly to the 
      Equilibrium Model, and assesses the robustness of this procedure and the effect of 
      assay data on the accurate determination of T(eq) and its associated parameters. It 
      also describes simpler experimental methods for their determination than have been 
      previously available, including those required for the application of the 
      Equilibrium Model to non-ideal enzyme reactions.

TI  - Changes in binding of hydrogen ions in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
PG  - 328-33
AB  - Most enzyme-catalyzed reactions produce or consume hydrogen ions, and this is 
      expressed by the change in the binding of hydrogen ions in the biochemical reaction, 
      as written in terms of reactants (sums of species). This property of a biochemical 
      reaction is important because it determines the change in the apparent equilibrium 
      constant K' with pH. This property is also important because it is the number of 
      moles of hydrogen ions that can be produced by a biochemical reaction for passage 
      through a membrane, or can be accepted from a transfer through a membrane. There are 
      two ways to calculate the change in binding of hydrogen ions for an enzyme-catalyzed 
      reaction. The first, which has been used for a long time, involves calculating the 
      partial derivative of the standard transformed Gibbs energy of reaction with respect 
      to pH. The second involves calculating the average numbers of hydrogen ions in each 
      reactant and adding and subtracting these average numbers. The changes in binding of 
      hydrogen ions calculated by the second method at pHs 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are given for 
      23 enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Values are given for 206 more reactions on the web. 
      This database can be extended to include more reactions for which pKs of reactants 
      are known or can be estimated.
