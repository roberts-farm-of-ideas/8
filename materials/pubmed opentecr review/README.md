# pubmed opentecr review

The files in this folder are the results of literature search on the topic of this repository: thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed reactions.

Search was conducted with PubMed, with different search terms.

The results were first screened by rating the title for "interestingness" regarding the topic of the search. In a second step, the abstracts were rated.

* `pubmed search results evaluated.ods`
  * This OpenOffice Calc file contains the ratings of the titles and the abstracts.
* `pubmed-list of exclusion terms.ods`
  * This OpenOffice Calc file is a collection of terms that appeared (seemingly) often in abstracts which were "uninteresting". Those terms are thus a potential good opportunity to sort/model abstracts with a mathematical model, so we get a prediction about the "interestingness" of not-human-evaluated abstracts.
* `2021-05-21 pubmed _equilibrium constant_ and enzyme since 2007`
