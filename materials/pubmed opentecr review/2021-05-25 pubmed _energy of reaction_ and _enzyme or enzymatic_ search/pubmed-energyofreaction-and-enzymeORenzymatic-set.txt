AB  - COVID-19, the disease caused by the newly discovered coronavirus-SARS-CoV-2, has 
      created a global health, social, and economic crisis. As of mid-January 2021, there 
      are over 90 million confirmed cases and more than 2 million reported deaths due to 
      COVID-19. Currently, there are very limited therapeutics for the treatment or 
      prevention of COVID-19. For this reason, it is important to find drug targets that 
      will lead to the development of safe and effective therapeutics against the disease. 
      The main protease (M(pro)) of the virus is an attractive target for the development 
      of effective antiviral therapeutics because it is required for proteolytic cleavage 
      of viral polyproteins. Furthermore, the M(pro) has no human homologues, so drugs 
      designed to bind to this target directly have less risk for off-target effects. 
      Recently, several high-resolution crystallographic structures of the M(pro) in 
      complex with inhibitors have been determined-to guide drug development and to spur 
      efforts in structure-based drug design. One of the primary objectives of modern 
      structure-based drug design is the accurate prediction of receptor-ligand binding 
      affinities for rational drug design and discovery. Here, we perform rigorous 
      alchemical absolute binding free energy calculations and QM/MM calculations to give 
      insight into the total binding energy of two recently crystallized inhibitors of 
      SARS-CoV-2 M(pro), namely, N3 and α-ketoamide 13b. The total binding energy consists 
      of both covalent and non-covalent binding components since both compounds are 
      covalent inhibitors of the M(pro). Our results indicate that the covalent and 
      non-covalent binding free energy contributions of both inhibitors to the M(pro) 
      target differ significantly. The N3 inhibitor has more favourable non-covalent 
      interactions, particularly hydrogen bonding, in the binding site of the M(pro) than 
      the α-ketoamide inhibitor. Also, the Gibbs energy of reaction for the M(pro)-N3 
      covalent adduct is greater than the Gibbs reaction energy for the M(pro)-α-ketoamide 
      covalent adduct. These differences in the covalent and non-covalent binding free 
      energy contributions for both inhibitors could be a plausible explanation for their 
      in vitro differences in antiviral activity. Our findings are consistent with the 
      reversible and irreversible character of both inhibitors as reported by experiment 
      and highlight the importance of both covalent and non-covalent binding free energy 
      contributions to the absolute binding affinity of a covalent inhibitor towards its 
      target. This information could prove useful in the rational design, discovery, and 
      evaluation of potent SARS-CoV-2 M(pro) inhibitors for targeted antiviral therapy.

AB  - The glycolytic pathway is one of the most important pathways for living organisms, 
      due to its role in energy production and as supplier of precursors for biosynthesis 
      in living cells. This work focuses on determination of the standard Gibbs energy of 
      reaction Δ(R)g'(0) of the enolase reaction, the ninth reaction in the glycolysis 
      pathway. Exact Δ(R)g'(0) values are required to predict the thermodynamic 
      feasibility of single metabolic reactions or even of metabolic reaction sequences 
      under cytosolic conditions. So-called "apparent" standard data from literature are 
      only valid at specific conditions. Nevertheless, such data are often used in pathway 
      analyses, which might lead to misinterpretation of the results. In this work, 
      equilibrium measurements were combined with activity coefficients in order to obtain 
      new standard values Δ(R)g'(0) for the enolase reaction that are independent of the 
      cytosolic conditions. Reaction equilibria were measured at different initial 
      substrate concentrations and temperatures of 298.15 K, 305.15 K and 310.15 K at 
      pH 7. The activity coefficients were predicted using the equation of state 
      electrolyte Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (ePC-SAFT). The 
      ePC-SAFT parameters were taken from literature or fitted to new experimentally 
      determined osmotic coefficients and densities. At 298.15 K and pH 7, a 
      Δ(R)g'(0)(298.15 K, pH 7) value of -2.8 ± 0.2 kJ mol(-)(1) was obtained. This value 
      differs by up to 5 kJ mol(-)(1) from literature data. Reasons are the poorly defined 
      "standard" conditions and partly undefined reaction conditions of literature works. 
      Finally, using temperature-dependent equilibrium constants and the van 't Hoff 
      equation, the standard enthalpy of reaction of Δ(R)h'(0)(298.15 K, 
      pH 7) = 27 ± 10 kJ mol(-)(1) was determined, and a similar value was found by 
      quantum-chemistry calculations.

PG  - 16139-16150

AB  - We report results of detailed empirical valence bond simulations that model the 
      effect of several amino acid substitutions on the thermodynamic (ΔG°) and kinetic 
      activation (ΔG(⧧)) barriers to deprotonation of dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP) 
      and d-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate (GAP) bound to wild-type triosephosphate isomerase 
      (TIM), as well as to the K12G, E97A, E97D, E97Q, K12G/E97A, I170A, L230A, 
      I170A/L230A, and P166A variants of this enzyme. The EVB simulations model the 
      observed effect of the P166A mutation on protein structure. The E97A, E97Q, and E97D 
      mutations of the conserved E97 side chain result in ≤1.0 kcal mol(-1) decreases in 
      the activation barrier for substrate deprotonation. The agreement between 
      experimental and computed activation barriers is within ±1 kcal mol(-1), with a 
      strong linear correlation between ΔG(⧧) and ΔG° for all 11 variants, with slopes β = 
      0.73 (R(2) = 0.994) and β = 0.74 (R(2) = 0.995) for the deprotonation of DHAP and 
      GAP, respectively. These Brønsted-type correlations show that the amino acid side 
      chains examined in this study function to reduce the standard-state Gibbs free 
      energy of reaction for deprotonation of the weak α-carbonyl carbon acid substrate to 
      form the enediolate phosphate reaction intermediate. TIM utilizes the cationic side 
      chain of K12 to provide direct electrostatic stabilization of the enolate oxyanion, 
      and the nonpolar side chains of P166, I170, and L230 are utilized for the 
      construction of an active-site cavity that provides optimal stabilization of the 
      enediolate phosphate intermediate relative to the carbon acid substrate.

TI  - Influence of Frozen Residues on the Exploration of the PES of Enzyme Reaction 
      Mechanisms.
PG  - 5486-5495
LID - 10.1021/acs.jctc.7b00768 [doi]
AB  - In this work, we studied one of the very widely used approximations in the 
      prediction of an enzyme reaction mechanism with computational methods, that is, 
      fixing residues outside a given radius surrounding the active site. This avoids the 
      unfolding of truncated models during MD calculations, avoids the expansion of the 
      active site in cluster model calculations (albeit here only specific atoms are 
      frozen), and prevents drifting between local minima when adiabatic mapping with 
      large QM/MM models is used. To test this, we have used the first step of the 
      reaction catalyzed by HIV-1 protease, as the detrimental effects of this 
      approximation are expected to be large here. We calculated the PES with shells of 
      frozen residues of different radii. Models with free regions under a 6.00 Å radius 
      showed signs of being overconstrained. The QM/MM energy barrier for the remaining 
      models was only slightly sensitive to this approximation (average of 0.8 
      kcal·mol(-1), maximum of 1.6 kcal·mol-1). The influence over the energy of reaction 
      was almost negligible. This widely used approximation seems safe and robust. The 
      resulting error is on average below 1.6 kcal·mol(-1), which is small when compared 
      with others deriving from, for example, the choice of the density functional or 
      semiempirical MO/SCC-DFTB method, the basis set used, or even the lack of sampling 
      or incomplete sampling.

TI  - Thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed esterifications: II. Levulinic acid 
      esterification with short-chain alcohols.
PG  - 7509-7521
LID - 10.1007/s00253-017-8481-4 [doi]
AB  - Levulinic acid was esterified with methanol, ethanol, and 1-butanol with the final 
      goal to predict the maximum yield of these equilibrium-limited reactions as function 
      of medium composition. In a first step, standard reaction data (standard Gibbs 
      energy of reaction Δ (R) g (0) ) were determined from experimental formation 
      properties. Unexpectedly, these Δ (R) g (0) values strongly deviated from data 
      obtained with classical group contribution methods that are typically used if 
      experimental standard data is not available. In a second step, reaction equilibrium 
      concentrations obtained from esterification catalyzed by Novozym 435 at 323.15 K 
      were measured, and the corresponding activity coefficients of the reacting agents 
      were predicted with perturbed-chain statistical associating fluid theory (PC-SAFT). 
      The so-obtained thermodynamic activities were used to determine Δ (R) g (0) at 
      323.15 K. These results could be used to cross-validate Δ (R) g (0) from 
      experimental formation data. In a third step, reaction-equilibrium experiments 
      showed that equilibrium position of the reactions under consideration depends 
      strongly on the concentration of water and on the ratio of levulinic acid: alcohol 
      in the initial reaction mixtures. The maximum yield of the esters was calculated 
      using Δ (R) g (0) data from this work and activity coefficients of the reacting 
      agents predicted with PC-SAFT for varying feed composition of the reaction mixtures. 
      The use of the new Δ (R) g (0) data combined with PC-SAFT allowed good agreement to 
      the measured yields, while predictions based on Δ (R) g (0) values obtained with 
      group contribution methods showed high deviations to experimental yields.

TI  - Thermodynamics of enzyme-catalyzed esterifications: I. Succinic acid esterification 
      with ethanol.
PG  - 5973-5984
LID - 10.1007/s00253-017-8287-4 [doi]
AB  - Succinic acid (SA) was esterified with ethanol using Candida antarctica lipase B 
      immobilized on acrylic resin at 40 and 50 °C. Enzyme activity in the reaction medium 
      was assured prior to reaction experiments. Reaction-equilibrium experiments were 
      performed for varying initial molalities of SA and water in the reaction mixtures. 
      This allowed calculating the molality-based apparent equilibrium constant K (m) as 
      function of concentration and temperature. K (m) was shown to depend strongly on the 
      molality of water and SA as well as on temperature. It could be concluded that 
      increasing the molality of SA shifted the reaction equilibrium towards the products. 
      Water had a strong effect on the activity of the enzyme and on K (m) . The 
      concentration dependence of K (m) values was explained by the activity coefficients 
      of the reacting agents. These were predicted with the thermodynamic models 
      Perturbed-Chain Statistical Associating Fluid Theory (PC-SAFT), NRTL, and Universal 
      Quasichemical Functional Group Activity Coefficients (UNIFAC), yielding the ratio of 
      activity coefficients of products and reactants K (γ) . All model parameters were 
      taken from literature. The models yielded K (γ) values between 25 and 115. Thus, 
      activity coefficients have a huge impact on the consistent determination of the 
      thermodynamic equilibrium constants K (th). Combining K (m) and PC-SAFT-predicted K 
      (γ) allowed determining K (th) and the standard Gibbs energy of reaction as function 
      of temperature. This value was shown to be in very good agreement with results 
      obtained from group contribution methods for Gibbs energy of formation. In contrast, 
      inconsistencies were observed for K (th) using K (γ) values from the classical 
      g(E)-models UNIFAC and NRTL. The importance of activity coefficients opens the door 
      for an optimized reaction setup for enzymatic esterifications.

TI  - Standard Gibbs Energy of Metabolic Reactions: I. Hexokinase Reaction.
PG  - 5665-5674
AB  - The standard Gibbs energy of reaction enables calculation of the driving force of a 
      (bio)chemical reaction. Gibbs energies of reaction are required in thermodynamic 
      approaches to determine fluxes as well as single reaction conversions of metabolic 
      bioreactions. The hexokinase reaction (phosphorylation of glucose) is the entrance 
      step of glycolysis, and thus its standard Gibbs energy of reaction (Δ(R)g°) is of 
      great impact. Δ(R)g° is accessible from equilibrium measurements, and the very small 
      concentrations of the reacting agents cause usually high error bars in data 
      reduction steps. Even worse, works from literature do not account for the nonideal 
      behavior of the reacting agents (activity coefficients were assumed to be unity); 
      thus published Δ(R)g° values are not standard data. Consistent treatment of activity 
      coefficients of reacting agents is crucial for the accurate determination of 
      standard Gibbs energy from equilibrium measurements. In this work, equilibrium 
      molalities of hexokinase reaction were measured with an enzyme kit. These results 
      were combined with reacting agents' activity coefficients obtained with the 
      thermodynamic model ePC-SAFT. Pure-component parameters for adenosine triphosphate 
      (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) were fitted to experimental osmotic 
      coefficients (water + Na(2)ATP, water + NaADP). Δ(R)g° of the hexokinase reaction at 
      298.15 K and pH 7 was found to be -17.83 ± 0.52 kJ·mol(-1). This value was compared 
      with experimental literature data; very good agreement between the different Δ(R)g° 
      values was obtained by accounting for pH, pMg, and the activity coefficients of the 
      reacting agents.

AB  - Thermodynamic principles have been applied to enzyme-catalyzed reactions since the 
      beginning of the 1930s in an attempt to understand metabolic pathways. Currently, 
      thermodynamics is also applied to the design and analysis of biotechnological 
      processes. The key thermodynamic quantity is the Gibbs energy of reaction, which 
      must be negative for a reaction to occur spontaneously. However, the application of 
      thermodynamic feasibility studies sometimes yields positive Gibbs energies of 
      reaction even for reactions that are known to occur spontaneously, such as 
      glycolysis. This article reviews the application of thermodynamics in 
      enzyme-catalyzed reactions. It summarizes the basic thermodynamic relationships used 
      for describing the Gibbs energy of reaction and also refers to the nonuniform 
      application of these relationships in the literature. The review summarizes 
      state-of-the-art approaches that describe the influence of temperature, pH, 
      electrolytes, solvents, and concentrations of reacting agents on the Gibbs energy of 
      reaction and, therefore, on the feasibility and yield of biological reactions.

AB  - In this work, Δ(R)g(+) values for the enzymatic G6P isomerization were determined as 
      a function of the G6P equilibrium molality between 25 °C and 37 °C. The reaction 
      mixtures were buffered at pH=8.5. In contrast to standard literature work, Δ(R)g(+) 
      values were determined from activity-based equilibrium constants instead of 
      molality-based apparent values. This yielded a Δ(R)g(+) value of 2.55±0.05 kJ 
      mol(-1) at 37 °C, independent of the solution pH between 7.5 and 8.5. Furthermore, 
      Δ(R)h(+) was measured at pH=8.5 and 25 °C yielding 12.05±0.2 kJ mol(-1). Accounting 
      for activity coefficients turned out to influence Δ(R)g(+) up to 30% upon increasing 
      the G6P molality. This result was confirmed by predictions using the thermodynamic 
      model ePC-SAFT. Finally, the influence of the buffer and of potassium glutamate as 
      an additive on the reaction equilibrium was measured and predicted with ePC-SAFT in 
      good agreement.

TI  - How metal substitution affects the enzymatic activity of 
      catechol-o-methyltransferase.
PG  - e47172
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0047172 [doi]
LID - e47172
AB  - Catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) degrades catecholamines, such as dopamine and 
      epinephrine, by methylating them in the presence of a divalent metal cation (usually 
      Mg(II)), and S-adenosyl-L-methionine. The enzymatic activity of COMT is known to be 
      vitally dependent on the nature of the bound metal: replacement of Mg(II) with 
      Ca(II) leads to a complete deactivation of COMT; Fe(II) is slightly less than potent 
      Mg(II), and Fe(III) is again an inhibitor. Considering the fairly modest role that 
      the metal plays in the catalyzed reaction, this dependence is puzzling, and to date 
      remains an enigma. Using a quantum mechanical / molecular mechanical dynamics method 
      for extensive sampling of protein structure, and first principle quantum mechanical 
      calculations for the subsequent mechanistic study, we explicate the effect of metal 
      substitution on the rate determining step in the catalytic cycle of COMT, the methyl 
      transfer. In full accord with experimental data, Mg(II) bound to COMT is the most 
      potent of the studied cations and it is closely followed by Fe(II), whereas Fe(III) 
      is unable to promote catalysis. In the case of Ca(II), a repacking of the protein 
      binding site is observed, leading to a significant increase in the activation 
      barrier and higher energy of reaction. Importantly, the origin of the effect of 
      metal substitution is different for different metals: for Fe(III) it is the 
      electronic effect, whereas in the case of Ca(II) it is instead the effect of 
      suboptimal protein structure.

TI  - Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships for C-C bond forming and C-C bond breaking 
      reactions in thiamine-catalyzed decarboxylation of 2-keto acids using density 
      functional theory.
PG  - 145-50

AB  - The concept of generalized enzyme reactions suggests that a wide variety of 
      substrates can undergo enzymatic transformations, including those whose 
      biotransformation has not yet been realized. The use of quantum chemistry to 
      evaluate kinetic feasibility is an attractive approach to identify enzymes for the 
      proposed transformation. However, the sheer number of novel transformations that can 
      be generated makes this impractical as a screening approach. Therefore, it is 
      essential to develop structure/activity relationships based on quantities that are 
      more efficient to calculate. In this work, we propose a structure/activity 
      relationship based on the free energy of binding or reaction of non-native 
      substrates to evaluate the catalysis relative to that of native substrates. While 
      Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi (BEP) relationships such as that proposed here have found 
      broad application in heterogeneous catalysis, their extension to enzymatic catalysis 
      is limited. We report here on density functional theory (DFT) studies for C-C bond 
      formation and C-C bond cleavage associated with the decarboxylation of six 2-keto 
      acids by a thiamine-containing enzyme (EC 1.2.7.1) and demonstrate a linear 
      relationship between the free energy of reaction and the activation barrier. We then 
      applied this relationship to predict the activation barriers of 17 chemically 
      similar novel reactions. These calculations reveal that there is a clear correlation 
      between the free energy of formation of the transition state and the free energy of 
      the reaction, suggesting that this method can be further extended to predict the 
      kinetics of novel reactions through our computational framework for discovery of 
      novel biochemical transformations.

TI  - A Non-Orthogonal Block-Localized Effective Hamiltonian Approach for Chemical and 
      Enzymatic Reactions.
PG  - 2242-2251
AB  - The effective Hamiltonian-molecular orbital and valence bond (EH-MOVB) method based 
      on non-orthogonal block-localized fragment orbitals has been implemented into the 
      program CHARMM for molecular dynamics simulations of chemical and enzymatic 
      reactions, making use of semiempirical quantum mechanical models. Building upon ab 
      initio MOVB theory, we make use of two parameters in the EH-MOVB method to fit the 
      barrier height and the relative energy between the reactant and product state for a 
      given chemical reaction to be in agreement with experiment or high-level ab initio 
      or density functional results. Consequently, the EH-MOVB method provides a highly 
      accurate and computationally efficient QM/MM model for dynamics simulation of 
      chemical reactions in solution. The EH-MOVB method is illustrated by examination of 
      the potential energy surface of the hydride transfer reaction from trimethylamine to 
      a flavin cofactor model in the gas phase. In the present study, we employed the 
      semiempirical AM1 model, which yields a reaction barrier that is more than 5 
      kcal/mol too high. We use a parameter calibration procedure for the EH-MOVB method 
      similar to that employed to adjust the results of semiempirical and empirical 
      models. Thus, the relative energy of these two diabatic states can be shifted to 
      reproduce the experimental energy of reaction, and the barrier height is optimized 
      to reproduce the desired (accurate) value by adding a constant to the off-diagonal 
      matrix element. The present EH-MOVB method offers a viable approach to 
      characterizing solvent and protein-reorganization effects in the realm of combined 
      QM/MM simulations.

TI  - Sequence specific interaction between promoter DNA and Escherichia coli RNA 
      polymerase: comparative thermodynamic analysis with one immobilized partner.
PG  - 15399-408
LID - 10.1021/jp9071197 [doi]
AB  - Sequence specific interaction between DNA and protein molecules has been a subject 
      of active investigation for decades now. Here, we have chosen single promoter 
      containing bacteriophage DeltaD(III) T7 DNA and Escherichia coli RNA polymerase and 
      followed their recognition at the air-water interface by using the surface plasmon 
      resonance (SPR) technique, where the movement of one of the reacting species is 
      restricted by way of arraying them on an immobilized support. For the Langmuir 
      monolayer studies, we used a RNA polymerase with a histidine tag attached to one of 
      its subunits, thus making it an excellent substrate for Ni(II) ions, while the SPR 
      studies were done using biotin-labeled DNA immobilized on a streptavidin-coated 
      chip. Detailed analysis of the thermodynamic parameters as a function of 
      concentration and temperature revealed that the interaction of RNA polymerase with 
      T7 DNA is largely entropy driven (83 (+/-12) kcal mol(-1)) with a positive enthalpy 
      of 13.6 (+/-3.6) kcal mol(-1). The free energy of reaction determined by SPR and 
      Langmuir-Blodgett technique was -11 (+/-2) and -15.6 kcal mol(-1), respectively. The 
      ability of these methods to retain the specificity of the recognition process was 
      also established.

TI  - H and other transfers in enzymes and in solution: theory and computations, a unified 
      view. 2. Applications to experiment and computations.
PG  - 6643-54
AB  - Equations obtained in part I for the free-energy barrier to one-step enzymatic 
      reactions between bound reactants are discussed. The rate is expressed in terms of 
      lambdao (protein reorganization energy), DeltaG(o) (standard free energy of reaction 
      of the H-transfer step), bond breaking/bond forming term, w (work terms), and 
      H-transmission property. Two alternative approximations for the coupling of the bond 
      breaking/bond forming and protein are distinguished experimentally in favorable 
      cases by the DeltaG(o) where the maximum deuterium kinetic isotope effect occurs. 
      Plots of log rate versus DeltaG(o) and properties such as DeltaS* and DeltaS(o) are 
      discussed. The weak or zero T-dependence of the kinetic isotope effect for wild-type 
      enzymes operating under physiological conditions is interpreted in terms of 
      vanishing (or isotopically insensitive) w plus transfer from the lowest H-state. 
      Static and dynamic protein flexibility is discussed. While the many correlations 
      accessible for electron transfers are not available for H-transfers in enzymes, a 
      combination of experiment, computation, and analytical approaches can assist in 
      evaluating the utility of the present equations and in suggesting further 
      experiments and computations. A protein reorganization energy lambdao is obtained in 
      the literature from the extended valence bond formalism where diabatic electronic 
      states are used. A method is suggested for extracting it when instead a bond 
      distance difference coordinate is used. The results may provide a bridge between the 
      two approaches.

TI  - Changes in binding of hydrogen ions in enzyme-catalyzed reactions.
PG  - 328-33
AB  - Most enzyme-catalyzed reactions produce or consume hydrogen ions, and this is 
      expressed by the change in the binding of hydrogen ions in the biochemical reaction, 
      as written in terms of reactants (sums of species). This property of a biochemical 
      reaction is important because it determines the change in the apparent equilibrium 
      constant K' with pH. This property is also important because it is the number of 
      moles of hydrogen ions that can be produced by a biochemical reaction for passage 
      through a membrane, or can be accepted from a transfer through a membrane. There are 
      two ways to calculate the change in binding of hydrogen ions for an enzyme-catalyzed 
      reaction. The first, which has been used for a long time, involves calculating the 
      partial derivative of the standard transformed Gibbs energy of reaction with respect 
      to pH. The second involves calculating the average numbers of hydrogen ions in each 
      reactant and adding and subtracting these average numbers. The changes in binding of 
      hydrogen ions calculated by the second method at pHs 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 are given for 
      23 enzyme-catalyzed reactions. Values are given for 206 more reactions on the web. 
      This database can be extended to include more reactions for which pKs of reactants 
      are known or can be estimated.

TI  - Probing Aspergillus niger glucose oxidase with pentacyanoferrate(III) aza- and 
      thia-complexes.
PG  - 1614-22
AB  - Complexes of pentacyanoferrate(III) and biologically relevant ligands, such as 
      pyridine, pyrazole, imidazole, histidine, and other aza- and thia-heterocycles, were 
      synthesized. Their spectral, electrochemical properties, electron exchange 
      constants, electronic structure parameters, and reactivity with glucose oxidase from 
      Aspergillus niger were determined. The formation of the complexes following ammonia 
      replacement by the ligands was associated with the appearance of a new band of 
      absorbance in the visible spectrum. The constants of the complexes formation 
      calculated at a ligand-pentacyanoferrate(III) concentrations ratio of 10:1, were 7.5 
      x 10(-5), 7.7 x 10(-5), and 1.8 x 10(-3) s(-1) for benzotriazole, benzimidazole, and 
      aminothiazole ligands, respectively. The complexes showed quasi-reversible redox 
      conversion at a glassy carbon electrode. The redox potential of the complexes 
      spanned the potential range from 70 to 240 mV vs. saturated calomel electrode (SCE) 
      at pH7.2. For most of the complexes self-exchange constants (k(11)) were similar to 
      or larger than that of hexacyanoferrate(III) (ferricyanide). The complexes 
      containing pyridine derivatives and thia-heterocyclic ligands held a lower value of 
      k(11) than that of ferricyanide. All complexes reacted with reduced glucose oxidase 
      at pH7.2. The reactivity of the complex containing pyrazole was the largest in 
      comparison to the rest of the complexes. Correlations between the complexes' 
      reactivity and both the free energy of reaction and k(11) shows that the reactivity 
      of pentacyanoferrates obeys the principles of Marcus's electron transfer theory. The 
      obtained data suggest that large negative charges of the complexes decrease their 
      reactivity.

      conformers (near attack conformers or NACs) increases by approximately 1100-fold in 
      going from room temperature (E.S298) to high temperature (E.S385). This increased 
      population of NAC conformers in the Michaelis complex correlates well with the 
      increase in rate in going from 298 to 385 K. The positioning of the two active site 
      residues Lys53 and Lys110 controls binding of the substrate in the favorable 
      orientation for general acid-catalyzed intramolecular ring formation reaction. It 
      can be concluded that the NAC formation allowing general acid catalysis has much to 
      do with the temperature dependence of the free energy of reaction.

PG  - 676-81
AB  - The esterification of geraniol with acetic acid in n-hexane was investigated. A 
      commercial lipase preparation from Candida antarctica was used as catalyst. The 
      equilibrium conversion (no water removal) was found to be 94% for the reaction of 
      0.1 M alcohol and 0.1 M acid in n-hexane at 30 degrees C. This was shown by both 
      hydrolysis and esterification reactions. The activation energy of reaction over the 
      temperature range 10 degrees to 50 degrees C was found to be 16 kJ/mol. The standard 
      heat of reaction was -28 kJ/mol. Membrane pervaporation using a cellulose 
      acetate/ceramic composite membrane was then employed for selective removal of water 
      from the reaction mixture. The membrane was highly effective at removing water while 
      retaining all reaction components. Negligible transport of the solvent n-hexane was 
      observed. Water removal by pervaporation increased the reaction rate by 
      approximately 150% and increased steady-state conversion to 100%.

TI  - Mitochondrial energy metabolism is regulated via nuclear-coded subunits of 
      cytochrome c oxidase.
PG  - 211-21
AB  - A new mechanism on regulation of mitochondrial energy metabolism is proposed on the 
      basis of reversible control of respiration by the intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratio 
      and slip of proton pumping (decreased H+/e- stoichiometry) in cytochrome c oxidase 
      (COX) at high proton motive force delta p. cAMP-dependent phosphorylation of COX 
      switches on and Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation switches off the allosteric 
      ATP-inhibition of COX (nucleotides bind to subunit IV). Control of respiration via 
      phosphorylated COX by the ATP/ADP ratio keeps delta p (mainly delta psi(m)) low. 
      Hormone induced Ca2+-dependent dephosphorylation results in loss of ATP-inhibition, 
      increase of respiration and delta p with consequent slip in proton pumping. Slip in 
      COX increases the free energy of reaction, resulting in increased rates of 
      respiration, thermogenesis and ATP-synthesis. Increased delta psi(m) stimulates 
      production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), mutations of mitochondrial DNA and 
      accelerates aging. Slip of proton pumping without dephosphorylation and increase of 
      delta p is found permanently in the liver-type isozyme of COX (subunit VIaL) and at 
      high intramitochondrial ATP/ADP ratios in the heart-type isozyme (subunit VIaH). 
      High substrate pressure (sigmoidal v/s kinetics), palmitate and 3,5-diiodothyronine 
      (binding to subunit Va) increase also delta p, ROS production and slip but without 
      dephosphorylation of COX.

TI  - Marcus rate theory applied to enzymatic proton transfer.
PG  - 88-103
AB  - The hydration of CO(2) and the dehydration of HCO(3)(-) catalyzed by the carbonic 
      anhydrases is accompanied by the transfer of protons between solution and the 
      zinc-bound water molecule in the active site. This transfer is facilitated by amino 
      acid residues of the enzyme which act as intramolecular proton shuttles; variants of 
      carbonic anhydrase lacking such shuttle residues are enhanced or rescued in 
      catalysis by intermolecular proton transfer from donors such as imidazole in 
      solution. The resulting rate constants for proton transfer when compared with the 
      values of the pK(a) of the donor and acceptor give Bronsted plots of high curvature. 
      These data are described by Marcus theory which shows an intrinsic barrier for 
      proton transfer from 1 to 2 kcal/mol and work terms or thermodynamic contributions 
      to the free energy of reaction from 4 to10 kcal/mol. The interpretation of these 
      Marcus parameters is discussed in terms of the well-studied pathway of the catalysis 
      and structure of the enzymes.

TI  - Properties of intramolecular proton transfer in carbonic anhydrase III.
PG  - 3182-9
AB  - We investigated the efficiency of glutamic acid 64 and aspartic acid 64 as proton 
      donors to the zinc-bound hydroxide in a series of site-specific mutants of human 
      carbonic anhydrase III (HCA III). Rate constants for this intramolecular proton 
      transfer, a step in the catalyzed dehydration of bicarbonate, were determined from 
      the proton-transfer-dependent rates of release of H2 18O from the enzyme measured by 
      mass spectrometry. The free energy plots representing these rate constants could be 
      fit by the Marcus rate theory, resulting in an intrinsic barrier for the proton 
      transfer of deltaG0++ = 2.2 +/- 0.5 kcal/mol, and a work function or thermodynamic 
      contribution to the free energy of reaction wr = 10.8 +/- 0.1 kcal/mol. These values 
      are very similar in magnitude to the Marcus parameters describing intramolecular 
      proton transfer from His64 and His67 to the zinc-bound hydroxide in mutants of HCA 
      III. That result and the equivalent efficiency of Glu64 and Asp64 as proton donors 
      in the catalysis by CA III demonstrate a lack of specificity in proton transfer from 
      these sites, which is indirect evidence of a number of proton conduction pathways 
      through different structures of intervening water chains. The dominance of the 
      thermodynamic contribution or work function for all of these proton transfers is 
      consistent with the view that formation and breaking of hydrogen bonds in such water 
      chains is a limiting factor for proton translocation.

TI  - Modulated growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae by altering the driving force of the 
      reactions of cytochrome c: Marcus' theory in vitro and in vivo.
PG  - 4878-85
AB  - According to Marcus' theory, rates of electron transfer reactions depend 
      parabolically on the free energy of reaction. Amino acid replacements in the 
      electron transport protein cytochrome c produced a series of proteins which changed 
      the free energy of reaction for cytochrome c in oxidative phosphorylation. This 
      study shows that Marcus' theory of electron transfer can be applied to the reactions 
      of redox-altered cytochromes c with cytochrome c1 both in vitro and in vivo. In 
      vitro, isolation of physiologically relevant partners of cytochrome c suggests that 
      a change in free energy of reaction of cytochrome c changes the rate of electron 
      transfer with cytochrome bc1 complex as would be predicted by Marcus' theory of 
      electron transfer. Furthermore, the reactivity pattern observed in vitro is 
      paralleled in in vivo studies. In vivo the rates of growth of Saccharomyces 
      cerevisiae, in which these alternatives have been incorporated, also are consistent 
      with the change in free energy of the reactions of cytochrome c with cytochrome bc1 
      complex. This study suggests that Marcus' theory of electron transport can predict 
      rates not only in vitro, in isolated protein-protein systems, but also in vivo, 
      where the relative growth rates of yeast may be predicted from the in vitro results.
